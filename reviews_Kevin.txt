ID: 1007939_950546656060564888, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: H√©bergement spacieux mais sombre. Serviette de toilette √† disposition. L'emplacement est tr√®s moyen √† mon sens. Nombreux commerces √† proximit√© : boulangerie, restaurant, superette, parc de jeux pour les enfants. Parc G√ºell, Sagrada Familia et la Casa Mila : 15 minutes √† pied, mais pour le reste c'est plus loin, ce n'est pas une position centrale : il est possible de prendre le m√©tro. L'h√¥te nous a inform√© d'arriv√©e par la ligne 4 du m√©tro, mais n'a pas mentionn√© que la ligne comportant la sortie Joanic pour acc√©der √† l'appartement √©tait en travaux pour plusieurs semaines et non accessible. Il y a bien 2 balcons comme indiqu√© mais l'un permet de mettre une table 2 personnes et la second n'en est pas un pour moi, puisqu'il n'est m√™me pas possible de loger debout dessus. Lit b√©b√© mis √† disposition mais sans matelas. Le petit + aurait √©t√© d'avoir une bouteille d'eau fra√Æche √† l'arriv√©e dans le frigo. Impossible d'acc√©der via la serrure connect√©e : pas fiable. Prix √©lev√©.

Sandra was an amazing host who gave me space while also feeling like when i needed needed her she would be right there. It was my first trip alone and it was the perfect transition apartment! Will be staying here again. 
ID: 1010828179627374481_1082467308431871620, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Chambre au top. Bien plac√©e. Proche du m√©tro. Propre, r√©nov√©e. Petit balcon orient√© soleil. L√©g√®rement bruyant, protection auriculaire recommand√©e si vous √™tes sensibles au bruit: la chambre donne sur une avenue principale de Barcelone. Cuisine propre, fonctionnelle, partag√©e avec les locataires des autres chambres airbnb de l‚Äô√©tage; tr√®s calme globalement, super propre. Mois de janvier avec prix relativement abordables; haute saison prix moins √©conomiques mais probablement en phase avec les tarifs barcelonais. En conclusion, super logement. Ne pas trop hesister..

It‚Äôs also on what I would consider the best shopping street in all of Barcelona. The host is very attentive and will help with anything you need. The negative of the place are the bugs. We contacted the host about Cockroaches being in the apartment and they told us that it is normal for this to happen in the summer. I can‚Äôt confirm the validity of that but I couldn‚Äôt write this review without mentioning it.

Originally I had wanted to stay in Eixample but after staying here, I think I might have preferred it more! Walking to Eixample is also just 20 minutes.<br/>The apartment is great and beautifully decorated. The internet speed is plenty fast if you were to work remotely. Between the desk in the bedroom and the dining room table, two people can work in separate rooms comfortably.<br/>I stayed in July and August when Barcelona is hot and humid and the A/C in the unit was excellent.

ID: 1094548_568689477180733915, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Sergio's place is great and we had an awesome stay there. It's bright and open with a very inviting terrace that gets sun from early morning to later afternoon (in Feb). It's a super location, close to lots of streets to explore and places to try out. <br/>There was usually some activity in the street until late at night on weekends but you should know that because it's Barcelona and you are sill central to places people want to be. Just bring earplugs and you're fine. We had a small problem with the magnetic door malfunctioning but they had a locksmith over to fix it immediately.

Although our room was at first a little tight, Mercedes allowed,us to keep our luggage in a store rom on the ground floor. The view over Placa Real from fear balcony each morning and evening was priceless. Apologies for the late review, but have had internet problems since leaving Barcelona.

ID: 1098894_12450506, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: This apartment was above and beyond my expectations! I was traveling with 6 other adult friends and needed a place big enough to not only accommodate us but give us all our own personal space for a week. This apartment couldn't have been a better fit. Each of us loved our rooms and bathrooms and we never felt 'on top of one another'. It was also so centrally located to shops, restaurants and some great historical Barcelona sights. We loved coming back to this apartment after a day of exploring. Eva was so kind and very prompt in answering any questions we had and even checked in a few days after our stay began to make sure all was going well. If I ever go back to Barcelona with a big group again, I won't think twice about staying here!

ID: 11197896_590448507794543774, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The apartment is very clean, modern with a full kitchen. The terrace was pleasant. The shower was small but it worked well. The rooms are also small but the beds were comfortable. Unfortunately, the noise from the construction right outside of our bedroom was unbearable. Drilling, hammering and other noise started at 8:15am and did not end until 7pm. The last day it was so loud that it hurt our ears. The building looks like it is only about 60% complete so I suspect the noise will continue. The onsite management said they were sorry but did not attempt to solve the problem. Also, I fell down the stairs from the terrace because the steps are slippery, and there is no railing to hold on to when going down the stairs. I am black and blue on my arm and most of my torso. This would be a great apartment if it was not for the construction and the stairs

ID: 11298610_429187047, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Great location right down the street from Plaza Catalunya. Metro and bus are very close by, giving you easy access to the entire city. Taxis are also very accessible via the taxi stop right across the street. The 24-hour supermarket next door is also very convenient for picking up snacks, water, and whatever everyday items you might need on your trip.<br/>Host is kind and quick to respond; the man who was responsible for checking us in was kind and helpful as well.<br/>Unfortunately when we arrived, there were several cleanliness issues. The shower curtain had started developing mold and should be replaced. A few of the kitchen items (like coffee makers) are old and appear stained/dirty, could use a deep cleaning. Both the bathroom and kitchen sinks were clogged and would quickly fill with water, taking a while to drain; upon informing the host he quickly scheduled a plumber, though we would have arrived after we checked out. <br/>The elevator had been out of service for six days when we arrived. Obviously the elevator is out of control of the host, though I wish I had been informed beforehand.<br/>Noisewise it is as you would expect as an older building on a relatively busy street. The apartment is up on the fifth floor so noise from the street is minimized. Sound does travel through the hall and walls, so you may hear others depending. Something for light sleepers to note, but no issues for sound sleepers.<br/>Overall an ideal location for any traveler, and assuming the issues I described are fixed, a good place to stay.

ID: 1137785735877154394_1225233261676185900, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Die Unterkunft schien zun√§chst f√ºr einen kurzfristigen Urlaub perfekt. Sie war preiswert, gut gelegen und hatte gute Bewertungen. Wir wurden aber schnell entt√§uscht. Das Zimmer war sehr dreckig, der M√ºll nicht mal entleert, Bettlaken war kr√ºmmelig, die Dusche voll mit Haaren und der Abfluss komplett verstopft. Wir hatten das Gef√ºhl es wurde nichts gemacht seit den letzten Besucher und obwohl wir aufgrund von Kommunikationsproblemen 2h l√§nger  warteten, als der eigentliche Check In(hier klare Empfehlung: feste Zeiten zu planen mit gen√ºgend Puffer. Flexibilit√§t ist in geringen Ma√üen m√∂glich) war das Zimmer dann noch nicht fertig. Das WLAN ging nicht und die Zimmert√ºr ging auch nicht abzuschlie√üen. Eidechsen waren unsere Mitbewohner. Auf R√ºckfragen diesbez√ºglich wurde erst gar nicht reagiert, sodass wir den Support kontaktierten. Also hygienischer war es sogar auf dem Bauernhof auf dem wir schliefen. Die Lage war aber Top und auch die Leute schienen eigentlich freundlich beim Check In.

We had our private space and there was always a nice ambiente in the flat. Donato leaves you your private space and you feel like at home. Who is searching for a quiet and nice decorated flat has found it`s right place ;)

ID: 1145940_979614935430778452, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The 6 of us had a lovely stay here at Blanc's and Marina's property. The location is only a 5 minute walk to the L4 metro at Joanic and a 10 minute walk to the Familia Sagrada. There is a very helpful hosts manual that shows locations of very local amenities. We highly recommend the local cocktail bar 'Saint Tropez'. The property has a ground floor and 1st floor bathroom, which was really useful for 6 adults. The pool is nice, deep enough ( chest height on your average adult), but not for swimming. Certainly great for cooling down. The patio is secluded but can be overlooked. We were there one week and saw somebody on another balcony maybe 3 times and we definitely didn't feel like this was any kind of problem at all. I would definitely recommend this AirBnB. Thanks x

Very comfy Queen bed and lovely rain shower in bathroom. <br/>There is a lot of traffic noise so if you are looking for a quiet place it may not suit. <br/>Really secure place lift up to the apartment. <br/>We loved it here and there are shops, cafes and bars all around you. Communication with Pedro was excellent and he really looked after us. Great place to stay when visiting Barcelona!

ID: 1161417_246411397, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: We really enjoyed being in Gracia where we could dine like a local at one of the squares while our kids joined in a game of kicking around a soccer ball; yet we were an easy walk to Sagrada Famillia and not far from other Modernisme sights with easy Metro down to El Bon etc.<br/>The space is exactly as pictured except that the building is gorgeous with some details that don't come out in the photos. The facilities are modest but completely functional. Small kitchen has 2 burners, microwave, toaster, clothes washer. Small bathroom has standup shower with good water pressure. The twin beds are rather firm and don't have a separate door. Our kids got a kick out of the curtain setup but if we were four adults looking to spend a week and cook a lot of meals there may be better options. The large table in the main room is very functional. Lay out all your stuff there and you can always find it. The street is not very loud (for Barcelona) and the windows and shutters can shut out most of the sound and all of the light. If you are sensitive to light when you sleep you should know that the main bedroom has a window facing into the building alcove. There is a curtain that shades the light well and we didn't find the building to be loud with people coming and going.  When we return to Barcelona will will certainly consider re-booking this home.

ID: 1169142_80966346, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Overall good experience. Great location in the Eixample neighborhood. Enough space for 3 or 4 people easily. Rooftop terrace is great as well. Only negatives were a horrible smell when we first moved in (so bad even the property manager commented on it and opened up windows/doors) and a shower curtain that ends up all over your body when you shower. Smell went away after due time, and you kind of get used to the shower curtain. Overall a good experience though, and would recommend to other Barcelona travelers.

ID: 1169191_84932902, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Stayed at Enric's apartment at the beginning of July 2016. Amazing location (how can it not be directly across from Sagrada Familia), pretty centralized in Barcelona and very close to the subway which is great in Barcelona. Not only is it a phenomenal apartment but Enric is an amazing host. Extremely accommodating before, during, and after the trip. Along with this amazing apartment you are basically being given a local tour guide at your disposal. He gave us customized recommendations every day and would adjust them based on what we wanted and where we were going that day. He spent as long as we wanted with us upon check in talking to us, giving tips, and answering questions. Not to mention a fully stocked fridge and pantry with local foods and drinks was amazing! Enric even arranged for us to have a taxi pick us up at 5:30am for an early flight! Enric is a great example of how truly amazing Barcelona/Catalunya are and to experience this amazing place in such a stunning apartment is worth the splurge. We can't wait to return to Barcelona and Enric's amazing apartment!

Most communication was done through the messaging app Whatsapp.  Location is in a quiet part of Barcelona, short walking distance to Sagrada Familia and Park Guell. Sagrada Familia is actually easily seen from the large kitchen window.  Amazing food and drink in the area, and after staying in other parts of the city, this location felt the most 'authentic'. Only one large bed but the couch easily sleeps one if needed. Very clean and it felt like home.

It‚Äôs conveniently located near the city‚Äôs mass transit stops and we could quickly travel anywhere we needed. The apartment is wonderfully set up for cooking in and the number of markets in the area encourage that, but the even larger number of fantastic little restaurants makes that decision difficult.

Mireya has some nice touches like milk, water, orange juice, spread, jam, pastry's etc and toiletries waiting for you. It is only 10-12 mins walk to Camp Nou and approx 2.5-3 Kilometres from the Ramblas. We will be hoping to go back to Mireya's when we go back to Barcelona.

The check in process was easy, and their hospitality and helpfulness is unmatched. The space was spotless when we arrived, and it truly feels like a place I could live in. The beds were comfortable, and even though we were just on the second floor, the street sounds were never an issue. I am excited to say that I will be booking here any time I am back in Barcelona, whether it is for a few days or a few weeks.

ID: 12960189_612882581, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: A well located apartment and generous welcome pack
ID: 1310443_13735381, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Vil was a very agreeable host and responded to all my questions and requests very quickly. Her assistant Jaume was also very helpful in getting us checked in and set up. The apartment itself was simple, cozy and clean - a perfect place to base our travels and to rest between adventures. It is near the El Clot metro station, which is very central and allowed us to travel all over town easily. The surrounding neighborhood is very pleasant as well, with many shops and a very nice park within walking distance. The apartment was very sunny and a nice breeze can pass through from the kitchen door to the balcony of the master bedroom. I would definitely consider staying there again!
ID: 13106697_602299532, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: This apartment is in a really good location. A couple of minutes from a quiet beach (in February), a 5 minute walk from the metro and near La Rambla del Poblenou. <br/>The apartment is beautifully styled and comfortable. It has everything you need and is stocked full of kitchenware, coffee pods, towels and cleaning supplies etc. <br/>We were welcomed by Sean who gave a quick overview of the apartment and the area including the welcome manual. If I had any issues I could contact Maria who responded promptly and was very helpful. <br/>This was excellent value for money and I'd definitely look at staying with one of the Homecelona apartments again!
ID: 13106697_768702301430681773, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Stayed here in Feb 2020 and this apartment met all the same expectations. <br/>It‚Äôs close to La Rambla Del Poblenou and about a 5-10min walk from the Poblenou metro station which takes you into the centre of Barcelona. <br/>The apartment itself is lovely. The beds are comfortable, it is clean, and there are some basics in the kitchen. It‚Äôs handy that they have a chromecast device which allows you to stream tv from a mobile device. <br/>The narrow lanes cause voices to carry so you do get a bit of noise from passers-by. If you go to bed early, you might find the noise disturbing until later in the evening. <br/>Sha is great. He is very responsive, friendly and helpful. We had an issue with the heating and Sha had someone out the next morning who fixed it straight away. <br/>We would recommend this apartment if you are visiting Barcelona.

ID: 1320149_459266497, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Es handelt sich um eine schicke und sehr saubere Wohnung. Es ist alles vorhanden was man ben√∂tigt (Bettw√§sche, Handt√ºcher, K√ºche, kleine Grundausstattung in der K√ºchen.<br/>Die Lage ist sehr zentral, da man in die Stadt zu Fu√ü kommt (ca. 20min zu den wichtigsten Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten). <br/>F√ºr diejenigen die abends gerne noch in einen  Club gehen ist es kein Problem ein Taxi zu nehmen und innerhalb von 10min ist man bei den besten Clubs von Barcelona.<br/>Rund um das Appartment gibt es mehrere M√∂glichkeiten einen Supermarkt, B√§cker oder √§hnliches zu finden. <br/>Auch gibt es rundherum viele kleinere Restaurants oder Bars, die sehr empfehlenswert sind und nicht typisch f√ºr Touristen sind.<br/>Eduard ist ein sehr freundlicher Gastgeber. Er hat gute Empfehlungen wo man essen kann und es liegt ein Stadtplan bereit. Er ist auch sehr flexibel was den Check-in & out angeht. Beim Verlassen logischerweise in Abh√§ngigkeit, wie das Appartement ausgebucht ist.<br/>Ich kann das Appartement w√§rmstens empfehlen.
ID: 13213043_458479070, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Our family of 4 spent a week in Marc's place.  The location cannot be beat.  We were able to easily walk to great restaurants and landmarks.  For those places that were not in walking distance, the metro is steps away.  For those who prefer to cook themselves, the public markets are within walking distance and there is a huge grocery store in the basement of the department store across the street.  I saw a recent complaint about the height of the ceiling on the second floor.  Yes, it is lower than typical, but it absolutely usable.  I am 6'5" tall and had no issues.  We would definitely stay at Marc's place again - highly recommended.

<br/>Also Ewa provided a booklet of very useful information prior to arrival which made getting from the airport and planning the trip much easier. A lovely extra touch.
<br/>Would definitely recommend staying here. 
ID: 1329829_455135064, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: It is one of the most stylish apartment we have ever stayed in. Very clean. A few minutes walk from Sant Antoni market. For those with physical limitations, there are 60 steps before arriving to the apartment (no elevator). Would definitely come back to Mike‚Äôs apartment and recommend!

ID: 13425534_275967326, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: A great spot in Barcelona--thanks!
ID: 13425534_535817949, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The apartment was lovely, in a great location. Very clean.<br/>Alvaro provided great service and responded immediately to any queries.<br/>We particularly enjoyed having the balcony at the front. We liked all the period features of the property, however the lack of sound insulation from adjoining apartments was problematic at times.
ID: 1343256_10133679, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The location of the apartment is great, very handy for public transport and it could hardly be closer to Sagrada Familia. Everything you need is nearby and it doesn't take long to walk to the centre of Barcelona if you fancy a stroll.
<br/>
<br/>Inside the apartment is pleasant and modern, with a nice comfy sofa. The heating was effective enough for the chilly January nights and there was plenty of light during the day.
<br/>
<br/>As other guests have commented it can be a bit noisy. The downstairs neighbours have dogs and you can hear the metro passing underneath the building. On the other hand that's part of city life in an old building and I didn't have any problems sleeping. My husband is more sensitive to noise, so he used earplugs.
<br/>
<br/>We were a bit disappointed by the state of the apartment when we arrived, the toilet hadn't been properly cleaned and the bed was only partly made. It seemed that the person who usually handles the cleaning/checkin was unavailable, so this could have been an anomaly. However when I contacted the owners their only comment was that " nothing is always perfect in a flat ... We are not professionals".
<br/>
<br/>We also discovered black mould growing on one of the walls, which Leila said they will get fixed. You might want to check on that before renting this apartment, especially if you have anyone with asthma or allergies with you.
<br/>
<br/>Overall I'd say it's a very nice apartment in a great location that was spoiled for us by a lack of attention to detail.

ID: 13780544_1148471928893684848, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Overall a nice stay with great location. access to everything in the city. Close to supermarket. Walking street so Taxi dropped us off down the block to carry all our luggage about 250meters, so be aware. First floor apt. was great as less stairs to climb. Apartment somewhat dark and could use more light. Great space to spread out and kitchen was well equipped. Floors are very old tiles that don't make the apartment feel clean.  Has good electrical converters for your electronics. Heating system is radiator style, just takes a bit longer to heat apt. if needed.  Has good laundry machine and dryer rack (no dryer).<br/>Bathroom is situated slight higher than rest of house which made it tricky especially in dark. The door to bathroom was a loud barndoor-type that lacked privacy to noise and view, so beware of privacy issues here. Great HOT water!<br/>Overall happy with our stay. Juan is exceptional at his job and was extremely helpful. Early AM Taxi to airport was able to pick up in front of apt.

ID: 13856102_310205803, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Just stayed in this lovely apartment for 5 nights during Gr√†cia‚Äôs festival and we had a blast.Right in the heart of a special part of Barcelona we felt we experienced a really different side to the city that I think is easy to miss if you simply go to all the usual tourist places.Not besmirching the rest of the city as it‚Äôs packed with attractions and we ran out of superlatives within a day or two.<br/>We ate tapas with the locals,Palestinian grub just round the corner,drank great beer walking the local streets listening to Cuban tunes one minute and Spanish folk the next,went to an amazing Flamenco show in El Born,got woken at 9am by mad people dressed as devils letting off fireworks to start the festival with a bang and so much more<br/>It‚Äôs a lovely apartment that has all you need and Naila was a great host although we had no need to ask her for any help during our stay<br/>Highly recommended and we‚Äôll be coming back in the future

The location was ideal - close to metro, restaraunt etc. We are an athletic family so the stairs were not a problem. That said, my parents (73+) wouldn‚Äôt be able to do it. Overall, great stay.  Thanks!
ID: 14004632_805615439368240046, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Convenient location with responsive host. But the space is smaller than expected, and hot water is limited (might need to wait 30min to 1hour if it‚Äôs used up).
ID: 14006090_1125257992806196275, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Fantastische plek samen met mijn vader en mijn zoon! We konden zo naar het voetbalstadion, de andere kant op zaten we zo bij het centrum.

ID: 14020724_265214598, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Check in was very easy and the representative was very nice. During our stay, the water heater was broken for 2 days so the showers were very cold. Once the heater was fixed, the showers were great and we were given a bottle of wine as compensation. The floors were dirty and we saw a bug on the bed on the last day. It was close to the metro which was nice, and we were able to walk up the hill to the Olympic stadium. We were able to store our bags in the company office before our flight which was nice. Overall, our stay here was mediocre.

It is in a great location, walking distance to everything you need - coffee shop on the corner, grocery stores within a few blocks, shops and restaurants, etc.<br/>The flat was modern and plenty of space. You have everything you need for home cooked meals and plenty of room to separate sleeping, working and living! The indoor balcony was a nice touch as well. Frank was very communicative and made sure everything was going smoothly.<br/>Highly recommend!

Walking distance to metro, La Rambla, and many Barcelona attractions. Lacked bed sheets and pillow covers though, which was the only downside. Everything else was spot on!
ID: 14346513_211143921, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: GREAT location - very central and right by Placa de Catalunya. It was perfect for us as we were only in Barcelona for the weekend and didnt want to spend a lot of time getting from one place to another. However, as it is central, you the area can be a little noisy til late, but it didnt really bother us (we slept well). Room is nice and clean, and Claudia responded quickly to all my questions and was very helpful!

Stays pretty cool/comfortable at night, the bed is amazingly comfortable.  All around amazing stay with great hosts......don't miss out on staying here! A+++

ID: 1530586_32076969, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Wonderful apartment in a great location. Clean and modern. Close to the metro and a non-touristy neighborhood. Check-in and checkout were a breeze. Jordi gave us a detailed walkthrough of must see places and restaurant recommendations when we arrived. He held onto our luggage after checkout to allow us to do our last day of sightseeing without carrying heavy weights. High recommended!

Alles was top; de gastvrouw was supervriendelijk, de kamer ruim en netjes, de badkamer was apart maar dik inorde. <br/>Er was een deffect aan de drinkwaterkraan, waarbij de gastvrouw onmiddelijk ingreep om een fles water aan te bieden aan ons. Ook de metrohalte Garcia was vlakbij de airbnb, slechts 2 haltes van Plaza Cataluyna. <br/>Zeker de moeite waard, wij boeken zeker terug bij deze airbnb!

ID: 1563402_686026554780093748, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Good apartment with a few flaws (blinds don't close fully everywhere, main light of master bedroom didn't work, ...). <br/>Perfect location, close to the beach and in nice neighborhood.<br/>Pool is nice and well maintained but no chairs to sit in or lay on.
ID: 15737782_1115178575742970123, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Carlos and Fernando were incredibly responsive and helpful before our arrival and throughout our stay. The apartment is in the perfect spot for those who want to be walkable distance to great bars (Dry Martini and Sips were fantastic) there is so much Good food from baked goods to brunch, tapas and dinner within a 10 minute walk and for the adventures outside of the neighborhood the metro is so easy to use and is so close. We stayed in the apartment with another couple and found it perfect for having time together in the space and feeling like we had quiet and privacy when we retired for the evening. <br/>Without exaggeration this was one of my favorite and most effortless stays- I will definitely book with Carlos again next trip to Barcelona.

The host was friendly and took the time to walk us through the unit and the map of Barcelona with recommendations. The apartment was clean and as described on the listing. We truly enjoyed our stay and would recommend others to do so while in Barcelona. Thank you!
ID: 1580522_1023824354400317390, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: We enjoyed our stay at Frederic‚Äôs apartment. It was in a good location, close to the Metro so we could explore the city. Only very slight negative was the noise from the flat above made by people moving around. That said it wouldn‚Äôt stop us staying there again.
ID: 1580586_465618432, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: I would give this apartment 10 stars if the app would permit. Highest recommendation. Outstanding location. Sparkling clean.

I would stay here again without any hesitation.

ID: 15881982_164941946, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Thanks for all the help.
ID: 15897898_278647269, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The place is pretty close to beach, in a slightly isolated area, and overall, a good location. It's annoying, however they make you use the Sweet Inn app to coordinate check in and I was passed around to a few different people so it made me nervous to get the keys, although it ended up being easy enough. A few of the items in the house didn't work, or were really worn and harder to use such as the front door, the sun blockers, and the shower.  It's over priced for what it is, however, a solid place to stay.
ID: 15947390_1012884922835585321, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Easy and welcoming check in. Had many inside tips for food and attractions. The location was an easy walk to most of our destinations, and when we couldn‚Äôt walk, a taxi hail was only a block away.

ID: 16060546_590422238352538695, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The apartment is equipped with everything you need. The terrace is quit large und is the highlight of the apartment. Overall the facility is a bit run down. One day the toilet didnt flush anymore but it got fixed the day after so it wasnt that much of a problem.<br/>The location is a bit outside the center but still fine for exploring the city. I recommend getting a 10 ticket for the metro.<br/>We had a great time in this apartment. The value for the price is outstanding and i would book it again.

ID: 1620407_183074641, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: I'll start of by saying I appreciate the flexibility with check-in. I arrived with a friend late at night and needed to check out VERY early the day of our departure. I appreciated the host(s)' willingness to accommodate these off-hour meetings, though we were charged 30 euros for it (like we agreed, this was not a surprise). <br/>The place itself, it's cozy. The larger bedroom is a good size although I did not find the bed particularly comfortable. It's not horrible, just a bit firm for my taste. The master bath is also spacious, which was appreciated. But be warned that it is not exactly private - it is sectioned off by a frosted glass wall that connects to the living area (sounds travel easily through).<br/>The other two bedrooms are very small. And the third bedroom was more of a quiet room/den/meditation room consisting of a couch (which may fold into a bed we didn't try) so keep that in mind when thinking of staying here with multiple people.<br/>The kitchen was stocked with basics - more than enough for us as we ate out for every meal. The A/C worked well to cool the living room and the windows were adequate for the rest of the flat at night. The wifi worked well, and the cable tv was appreciated for when we needed a break from exploring. <br/>The main draw to this place for us was the location. It's central enough to get where you want to go in a timely fashion but not located in a crowded tourist area. There is enough within a two block radius to grab a bite, a drink, or pick up a few things at nearby grocery stores. it is also located just a few blocks from most of the gay bars. So, if you're gay, this can be a plus.<br/>Overall I'd recommend this place to a friend. No major issues, seamless check-in and check-out, comfortable enough especially for the price, and located in a great area. <br/>Thank you!
ID: 1620515_52216214, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Phil and Fiona have a great apartment in Barcelona.  The location is excellent - several good restaurants and cafes near by, and very close to two metro stations - one of them being one of the most major in the city.<br/>They provide very good towels and the rooms are comfy.  I was very impressed with the place - it's in an old building but it's obvious that the unit has been renovated recently.  I'd recommend this place!

ID: 16433084_259932443, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Alfonso was an amazing host, deserving of his super host status. He was very helpful and friendly. He gave me lots of little tips for things to see in the city and where to eat. As for the the apartment it was modern and very clean. The room has an interior window which makes it free from street noise which is important in central Barcelona. It also had a roof fan to keep me cool on the hot days and heating which I didn't need to use. The location was great as I could walk into the centre in 15 minutes but was still way from the tourist crowds. It was good for transport links being next to metro red line 1 and close to the green line 3.

Just off of Las Ramblas, pretty much in the thick of the gothic quarter, and a 2-minute walk to the metro that will take you pretty much anywhere.  If you‚Äôre looking for a place in Barca where all the action is and don‚Äôt mind a little noise at night, this place is a gem!  Jon was a gracious host, that we would recommend anyone to stay with.

One of the nicest hosts you will meet. Also, the location is right in the heart of Rambla, which in my opinion is where all the action is. Also, there is a cat in his apartment which is literally a dog. The cat wouldn't let me go and waited for me by the door every time, I was super amused.<br/>Anyway, stay at Teo's and you will enjoy Barcelona, that's a guarantee! Thanks Teo!

ID: 17051593_922301349218633549, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: I stayed here for a little over a month, and overall it was a great place, especially for the cost!<br/>The good:<br/>- Bigger than expected, and includes a surprise extra half bath<br/>- Daria is super responsive and accommodating. She responded very quickly any time I had an issue and allowed me to store my bags after checkout<br/>- Location = amazing. Very close to several metro stations, tons of eating/drinking options nearby<br/>The less good:<br/>- The wifi is not super reliable. Might not be a good option if you're planning to work remotely<br/>- As of June 2023, there is still construction going on right outside the apartment in the courtyard below. Sometimes it's not too loud, but other times it's very loud and disruptive. The windows are quite old so they provide almost no sound insulation<br/>- The apartment is on the 2nd floor (3rd floor for Americans), but there are about 50 steps to climb<br/>As long as you can live with the above quirks, I would still very much recommend staying here!

ID: 1728329_957819392824255664, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: A great location to stay in but if I returned I would look around for another accommodation. It‚Äôs in a convenient location near the Arch and metro and walking distance to Gothic Quarter, Sagrada, and lots of other great spots. The space needs some attention, though. Shower curtain was stained up and dirty. There was only a sheet on the bed and the comforter in the closet had stains on it. The kitchen was lacking some basics we hoped for. The deck is a nice touch. Though Rosa herself was a super host, the space did not live up to expectations.
ID: 17314782_625174234098686480, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Everything was good however, there was a lot of noise due to construction.
ID: 17343899_1182470411443226019, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: This place was great. The location was perfect, there were many restaurants nearby and a supermarket across the street. <br/>A quick cab ride or moderate walk to all the tourist locations like Park Guell, La Pedrera, Sagrada Familia and Gothic Quarter.<br/>Very helpful with restaurant suggestions and accommodating our early arrival. The balcony and view was amazing! We would definitely stay here again.
ID: 1737505_244693383, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: This apartment is located in a residential neighbourhood close to the beach and port Olympic. The L4 metro is a short walk away (I recommend a T10 ticket which gives you 10 journeys for just over 10 euro). The apartment is just as the photos depicts it and Jane and Javier are fantastic hosts. There is a little convenience store at street level with all of your basics and plenty of small bars, cafes and restaurants within easy walking distance. This is a safe residential neighbourhood off the tourist beat, but I think this is one of the great attractions. Janes apartment is a great place to stay and I would definitely choose it again if it‚Äôs available the next time I return to visit this amazing city.
ID: 1737505_728075380827106215, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: El apartamento de Jane es muy bonito, cerca de la playa y de los comercios. La predisposici√≥n de Jane siempre fue la mejor, es muy agradable, el departamento estaba hermoso y limpio, s√∫per importante. Volver√© indudablemente. Mil gracias

ID: 1744379_180290571, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Eli & Agus's apartment in Barcelona is a clean, centrally-located spot that is great for people visiting Barcelona. It was just a short 10 minute walk from the apartment to La Sagrada Familia and to the metro. We were able to get to Camp Nou, Las Ramblas, and the Gothic Quarters very easily from the place. Eli & Agus are also very responsive and accommodating. They let us drop off our luggage at the place while it was being cleaned, so we could explore the city without dragging our luggage around. Just a couple tips for future travelers: there are no elevators so be prepared to carry your luggage a few flights up and while having AC was nice, it wasn't strong enough to feel in the rooms.
ID: 1744379_718607980237777340, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Great location! Very close to many sites and metro stops. The check in process was smooth and the space was excellent.
ID: 17472277_247670884, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: This AirBNB is VERY close to the beautiful La sagrada Familia. Great sights. Very close to metro stop as well. It definitely is a quieter neighborhood and not that many places open later at night, if you're into that sort of thing.<br/>The place was very clean and is accurately depicted in the pictures. Jose was very responsive via email/Whatsapp and was very pleasant during our check-in.<br/>We had 2 couples that stayed. Initially one couple stayed in one of the 2 rooms with King beds. The other couple stayed in the room with 2 twin beds pushed together. The king beds are definitely more comfortable than the twin beds.<br/>Otherwise, a pleasant experience in a cool city.

ID: 17629946_536164923, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: This place is in a great location. 5mins walk to the nearest station, and 10mins walk to La Rambla. <br/>Yolanda was very friendly and stayed up til 2am waiting for us.<br/>The bedroom is a bit small, but the living room is pretty spacial, so we chilled there since most of the time no one else was home. <br/>The place was on the fourth floor with no lift, so it was a bit tiring going in and out of the flat. <br/>I enjoyed my stay. And for the price, it's definitely value for money. <br/>Thank you again for hosting us!
ID: 17632700_471761703, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: We booked same day from London and arrived several hours later. We had to wait 2 hours to be let inside the condo at 7:30pm. Two days later when we were to leave, we requested a checkout of 12:00 but they were inside at 11 exactly and had moved our things, getting ready for next guest, we arrived at 11:20am to collect our things. Very unprofessional and unacceptable. The place was good otherwise.
ID: 17632700_814320448882870962, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Very nice apartment located near a metro station (Urgell).  Good central location that was walkable to most tourist attractions including Placa de Catalunya and La Rambla. We had the whole apartment to ourselves (7 pax) and having two bathrooms was useful. The kitchen was clean and had all the appliances we needed to cook breakfast every morning and a couple of simple dinners. Bedrooms were comfortable. The whole apartment was warm even during the cold winter days. The host (Joan) gave a very full and clear explanation of the apartment  upon our arrival and also gave us some useful tips and eating out recommendations which were really good. A nice place to stay if you are traveling in a group and prefer to have the whole apartment to yourselves.

His breakfast was very tasty and plenty for our needs.<br/>The accommodation was just what we needed and everything was as described. <br/>We were within walking distance of the Metro and the train station and very central.
ID: 17672694_712165160676213231, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The apartment is in an amazing location. Very quiet area but still has plenty of small bars and restaurants within a 15 minute walk. Beds were comfortable and Sweetinn, the management company, communicated very well! Highly recommend.

We had contact with people one informed us that the toilet was broken and the other that answered the phone (Francisco's phone) was not able to communicate with us well.  Toilet overflowed the 3rd day we were there apparently they never had it fixed.  Apartment was bit very neat.  We are playing a new game "Where's Francicso"

ID: 17935561_233168871, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Unsere Ankunft in Mabels Zimmer war sehr herzlich, sie hat alles wichtige f√ºr uns vorbereitet (Shampoo, Handt√ºcher, Kaffee, Wasserflasche). Au√üerdem hat sie uns f√ºr unser Abendessen einen g√ºnstigen Italiener empfohlen, bei dem wir gut essen konnten. Ihre Wohnung ist wirklich sehr sehr s√º√ü eingerichtet, es h√§ngen viele Bilder und Kunstwerke von ihr und anderen K√ºnstlern an der Wand. Das Zimmer ist klein, aber hat alles, was es braucht um ein paar Tage zentral in Barcelona verbringen zu k√∂nnen! Es gibt viele Tapasbars und kleine Gesch√§fte in der Umgebung. Es war ein wenig kalt in der Wohnung, aber wir hatten einen kleinen Ofen in unserem Zimmer, der es ziemlich schnell aufgew√§rmt hat. Im Sommer er√ºbrigt sich dieses Problem wahrscheinlich von selbst. Bei Fragen konnte man sich zuverl√§ssige und schnelle Antworten von Mabel erwarten! Ganz klare Empfehlung f√ºr das sehr sehr g√ºnstige Zimmer mit grandiosem Preis-Leistungsverh√§ltnis!
ID: 17935561_447307122, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Die Wohnung liegt super zentral im Herzen von Barcelona - alles ist schnell zu Fu√ü erreichbar. In der Umgebung befindet sich dementsprechend alles, was man braucht. Auch die Anbindung an die √∂ffentlichen Verkehrsmittel ist gut. Da sich die Unterkunft im vierten Stock befindet, sollte man mit ‚Äûkleinem‚Äú Gep√§ck anreisen - nicht zu untersch√§tzen! ;-) Ab und zu war es in unserem Zimmer ein wenig hellh√∂rig, was wir aber √ºberhaupt nicht schlimm fanden! Es ist halt kein Touri-Appartement. ;-)<br/>Mabel ist ein wirklich gro√üartiger Host! Sie hatte immer ein offenes Ohr, war super zuvorkommend und gab uns viele tolle Tipps. Auch Wasser und ein wenig Obst hat sie f√ºr uns bereitgestellt. Die Kommunikation war auf allen Ebenen einwandfrei.  <br/>Alles in allem nur zu empfehlen <br/>Vielen, lieben Dank, Mabel! <br/>Liebe Gr√º√üe<br/>Kevin & Finn-Victoria
ID: 1800198_968704521191607553, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: From the moment we booked we were in great hands. When we arrived we were greeted at the street door and escorted inside and up to the apartment. All amenities were throughly explained from the microwave to the AC. A detailed list of things to do was given and the house was extremely helpful. If there was a 10 star button, I would select it for this stay!  It was a great experience and we will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Barcelona!!! If only every host could be this great, I would never book a hotel again!!

A huge park is located literally across the street.  Even though El Born is such a fun area full of activities, this apartment is so quiet that you won‚Äôt be disturbed if you want to sleep in or late.  If I go back again, I will want to stay there without a doubt.

ID: 18887616_401242013400461193, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: First, the host is amazing - he went above and beyond making sure everything worked for the stay. We were well stocked with food and drinks when we arrived, and the Internet is amazing (fiber optic). <br/>The place is nicely decorated with art prints and tasteful photos of Barcelona. The apartment is large and well laid out with closets and air conditioning in the bedrooms and living room. The place was very clean and beds were very comfortable. The kitchen has stocked with all the things you need and the washer and dryer work very well. It's on an upper floor and the building is well constructed, so it's very quiet - this a big plus in Barcelona, where some peace and quiet is appreciated after a day in the city.<br/>The place was well located, far enough out from the touristy areas to be less crowded but close enough to reach everything easily (30 min walk or 15-20 min drive), with public transportation immediately nearby. We often just walked to all the sites because Barcelona is so nice.<br/>There are a lot of good restaurants and cafes nearby for morning espresso (cafe literally across the street with breakfast pastries). There is also good shopping within 15 minutes walk, away from all the touristy shopping areas in city center. <br/>We highly recommend this place for all types of visitors (families, couples, etc.).  Thank you Leo for sharing your great place with us!

Very quiet on top floor of 6 story building with small back patio partial view of Sagrada Familia a couple of blocks away and great afternoon sunshine. Modest place within 15 min walk of cool part of Gracia (not really as central to it as I had imagined but more my fault in not knowing). Kitchen was fine though missing a few utensils. Ana was very clear and communicative before so we knew exactly what we were getting and happy with it over all.

ID: 19053607_204281403, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: I stayed here for a week with my fiance and couldn't have had a better time!  This was our first time in Barcelona and Ana was so helpful during check-in, giving great recommendations for places to check out near the unit, and by providing quick responses to any questions that we had.  The location of the unit was fantastic, with only a short 5 minute walk to the closest metro stop.  It also happened to be very nearby a great street full of pintxos restaurants (highly recommend checking out all, especially Pincho J).  As others mentioned, there were a lot of steps from the street up to the unit, but the views from the balcony were definitely worth it!  Apartment was clean with all needed items provided, and perfect for our time there.  I highly recommend this place and would definitely stay here again the next time we come to Barcelona.

ID: 19280939_539431574, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: We enjoyed our sty at this property although there were some things I feel could have been done differently. In particular, the property demanded far too much of my time before we arrived. We had to send passport details for each guest and give flight details which is a tedious task to have to do on top of all the other things before you travel. Also once at the property we were then given a tour by a lovely host. While this was nice it was a bit overkill. There wasn‚Äôt anything complicated at the property that warranted a walk-through and I think the property would benefit from using lockboxes and welcome baskets instead- as this is less intrusive. <br/>With that said I would highly recommend a stay at this property- the view and location can‚Äôt be beat and the property was mostly well cleaned.
ID: 19321199_610764364, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Great value and great location and proximity to the metro. A bit of an issue with hot water, however we had 8 adults staying there so it may perform better with a smaller group. All in all would stay again.

ID: 19343873_727287918792879008, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Really spacious place with metro stop just down the street and a bus stop as well, neighborhood is super chill. 10 mins walk to the market to get some fresh fruits and seafood.  Anastasia was kind enough to let us check-in before lunch and was always available to answer any of our questions.
ID: 1940776_531747098, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Judith was very kind and helpful. She provided a ton of tips for what to see around the city, where to go for food, etc.  The apartment is close to the old city for walking as well as the subway for easy travel.
ID: 19536690_452679809461713910, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Had a lovely stay at Luis‚Äô Apartment. Everything was clean and tidy when we arrived and he was always available whenever we needed him.
ID: 19536698_198408421, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Great location and apartment. Easy access and host was helpful after we were delayed in arriving.
ID: 19536700_238930829, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Staying at this apartment was a terrible experience. To Luis's credit, he did arrange for a member of my party to drop bags off early. That was the only positive part of the experience and Luis later tried to tell AirBnB staff that the reason the apartment wasn't clean was because of our early check in.<br/>First off, the apartment is in serious disrepair. Wall paper is pealing off the walls, multiple light fixtures were broken, there is a huge amount of dust on light fixtures. It's appointed with by far the cheapest materials money can buy. Not a single dish in the apartment matches, the towels were probably 30 years old and the handles on the fridge and washing machine were broken off. The apartment also lacks basic amenities like a place to hang towels in the bathrooms.<br/>Second, the bedding on the beds was extremely old and dirty. When I complained to Luis, he at first denied there was an issue and then promised to personally replace the bedding. Turns out he had the owner go over and put new sheets (the cheapest sheets money can buy, mind you) on the beds but they used the same disgusting, stained and soiled blankets that had been on the beds previously. After providing photographic evidence to AirBNB we were refunded our money and we left after one miserable night spent sleeping in our clothes on top of dirty, disgusting bedding. <br/>In addition, the building itself is extremely loud and in it's own state of disrepair. People sleeping in interior rooms were woken many times during the night by slamming doors from other residents. The interior entry lights to the building and staircase were not in working order while we were there, which is a pretty serious safety and security concern. The apartment is on the third floor, so anyone staying here has to navigate two narrow, steep staircases in the dark.<br/>Luis is not the owner of this apartment, he is a property manager who works in conjunction with owners to run this place like a slum lord. It's obvious that the owner and Luis do not take pride in keeping this place in good working order. I strongly recommend against staying here.
ID: 19536711_206815743, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Very good location for what my sister and i needed. Within walking distance of a lot of places. Public transport near by. Taxi was reasonable too. Spacious, homely appartment with a lift. Quiet area but close to supermarkets and the busy nightlife. Felt safe around the apartment always. Could not make it to the football but went to all the main sites, watched barca play basketball and saw a couple of flamenco and guitar shows. Fast response to a couple of messages about check in and out which was great. Thank you Luis & co.

ID: 19563158_473717615360385546, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: First I want to start by saying that Eli and Agus were fantastic hosts. They are incredible at communicating. We had several questions since we were visiting during COVID and they answered every one with detail. They are extremely organized sending us all materials needed for our trip well in advance to make sure that our visit would be as smooth as possible. <br/>The apartment is perfection! Could not have asked for anything better. It is clean, spacious, and perfect for a short or long term stay. Wifi and AC all worked very well. The washer and dryer was an excellent addition (I would definitely recommend to ask Eli and Agus the recommended settings before your first use). The location is stellar, close to so many cafes, restaurants, bars, and stores. They also have a great board with recommended places to go - we found a ton of great spots from it. <br/>Overall we loved our stay and would highly recommend Eli and Agus!

ID: 1957157_286932816, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Great apartment and fabulous location.  Everything within walking distance, but yet not in a touristy area.  Close to great restaurants and food markets.  The apartment was clean and had very nice amenities.  We really enjoyed the use of the kitchen and the stacked washer/dryer was very useful for us.  Also, Juanjo was very responsive and although could not make our check-in, his assistant, Carlos, was very hospitable and made the check-in process very smooth.  Carlos even arranged our taxi service back to the airport on our departure date.  Would definitely recommend to others and rent again in the future.

ID: 196021_1930308, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Julia is one of the most amazing hosts i have ever met,
<br/>she's so hospitable and her attention to details is immaculate.
<br/>She prepares food and wine for us on our arrival, gave us 10 pairs of keys for each and everyone of us and even gave us 2 local phones to use in Barcelona!
<br/>
<br/>We feel so well taken care of during our stay and during our last day after we checked out, she happened to be away on holidays in Italy and one of my friend forgotten his phone and she was so kind to ask her mum to rush back to the apartment to open the door for my friend to pick up his phone. We felt so bad about it and really really grateful to her for her help!
<br/>
<br/>Julia is definitely the best host to go to if you are looking for a space in Barcelona not to mention her apartment is beautiful and can host big groups with her 5 rooms too!
<br/>
<br/>Thanks again Julia and your mum for such a wonderful stay in Barcelona!

There were a few hiccups however; we could not complete the auto check in due to a broken card reader, we were requested to let a maintenance person enter to fix a screen, the refrigerator was not plugged in (we thought it was broken), and the main shower leaked a significant amount of water into the hallway.

We really enjoyed the large balcony in the back were we relaxed in the evening. The elevator was also a huge help especially with our luggage. Alexandra was very nice and met us in person to do the check in. She also stayed in touch with us to make sure everything was going great. We would absolutely love to stay here again in the future.

ID: 2045063_557132253, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: This is a great place and neighborhood to stay in Barcelona. We felt very comfortable and safe staying here. The layout is very nice and felt like an apartment you‚Äôd want for yourself in Barcelona. Well decorated and felt within the culture. The bedrooms are on the smaller side, but provided that you‚Äôre not in Barcelona for just staying in the apartment, they‚Äôre plenty adequate. The bedroom with the en suite has a firmer than normal mattress, so that‚Äôs a consideration. Otherwise, the pedestrian only street keeps the noise low with a great gelato find just within a couple minutes walk from the apartment. Lovely place and a great place to stay while visiting!

We normally do minimum 4 star hotel but we loved this place and are planning to return when visiting Barcelona in the very near future.

<br/>Her apartment is located in an enjoyable part of Barcelona ‚Äì Poblenou: Directly near the Las Ramblas of Poblenou with all of their possibilities of lovely tapas-Bars, restaurants, nice shops etc.. Also the Market of Poblenou is near as well as the beach is to walk almost 15 minutes. The metro station is only 1 minute to walk away and you can reach Barcelonas centre very fast. 
<br/>So, we suggest the apartment to everyone who will have an exciting and comfortable trip to Barcelona. It varified between action and sightseeing but also to relax and have a really good time, in lovely Poblenou and in the cool apartment! 
<br/>The apartment itself is very clean and in a modern style. The kitchen fitments had everything you need. The 2 bathrooms are really comfortable and the big apartment give possibility to store your own things, relax out on the terrace or on the couch and enjoy easy your meanwhile HOME!

If you have a hard time walking up stairs then be careful. Otherwise this location is perfect for the Barcelona vacation, we highly recommend it!

ID: 21688118_543332082586299251, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: We liked it. It is not in the center of BCN, but is a nice area and a short train ride to the center of the action. It was clean and nice. The terraces were nice - I wish it had been warmer so we could use the grill. You need a phone with internet to get in the first time so I had to run and buy a temporary SIM card, but was going to need to do that anyway. It was a quiet stay, with plenty of restaurants and groceries nearby.<br/>Yeah, it was like a decent hotel room but also had a kitchenette, washing machine, a nice terrace with a view, and a grill. We enjoyed our stay.

ID: 21721631_607789943856738683, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: What a fantastic location! A great flat, with good sized rooms and enough space for two couples to get ready and spend the weekend. The balcony is a great feature with a lovely view. <br/>I think for the money it's quite good  and deserves 4stars however it needs a bit of TLC, some repairs etc and it would have been 5stars.

ID: 21722004_315199495, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Great place with a very central location a couple blocks away from las rambles. The apartment was clean and very beautiful. Additionally, the photos are accurate as detailed on the listing. <br/>There were a few issues though with the place. The dresser closet broke the moment we opened the door as the shelving units fell. The dryer was not working properly (I learned that the water tank had not been emptied by previous renters). The soap dispenser in the bathroom was not attached to the wall.
ID: 21722097_535751644, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The service was great and the apartment matched the description well. Unfortunately, there were a few problems (some of which were out of the owner‚Äôs control):<br/>1. The bathroom shower curtains were not clean<br/>2. The fold-out couch in the living room was so uncomfortable that we had to pull the mattress off and place it on the floor. In addition, the living room is above a street corner that proved to be very noisy. <br/>3. We were prepared for a lively, late-night atmosphere, but most of the noise came from a series of drug dealers who plied their trade right beneath our window all day and night. They were not subtle about their business and they could be rude at times.<br/>Given these issues, I would still consider renting this apartment again, but probably not if the group was large enough to require using the living room as a sleeping area.

We felt so safe in the neighborhood, even being out late for drinks/ tapas. Upon arrival we were greeted by her father and he was so kind and informative. We honestly couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place to spend our time here.

ID: 2187751_456337470, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: We loved this apartment. The height means that you‚Äôre not going to hear any of the street noise. Having a nice terrace to relax on was great for having meals outside. The apartment stayed cool and comfortable, and the kitchen is setup for doing actual cooking. The next time we come to Barcelona, I hope this apartment is available.

We stayed on the 5th floor and there is no elevator - not a problem for us, but just something you should be aware of should you want to stay here. Bus stop right nearby and very easy to walk to many places in the city from this location. Highly recommend staying here.

Zudem steht in der Beschreibung zwar, dass Basics wie Salz, Pfeffer etc. nicht vorhanden sind, geh√∂rt f√ºr mich pers√∂nlich trotzdem zu einer "gut" ausgestatteten K√ºche dazu.<br/>-Es wurden 2 mikrige angefangene Rollen 1 lagiges Toilettenpapier gestellt. Auf Nachfrage f√ºr mehr wurde nur gesagt, kauft euch selbst mehr ihr bekommt nichts. <br/>-Schlie√üanlage ist ein Mal ausgefallen, sodass wir nicht ins Appartement konnten.<br/>-Wifi ging 1 Tag lang nicht<br/>-Ein Stockwerk oben dr√ºber stehen die Kompressoren f√ºr die Klimaanlage.

A few things were missing (like extra towels, trash bins) and other things were broken (drawers, shower head, the light in one of the rooms). These should be fixed for the next guest.

ID: 22235775_284868006, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Overall very good. Some essentials were missing though, for example there was a frying pan but no spatula. One of the rooms was rather noisy, you could hear a flow of pouring water on the outside during the night (it wasn't rain) and one night there was some kind of engine going on and off all night long. 
ID: 22330913_490123147, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Die Lage ist sehr gut. Bis zum Strand sind es ca 25 min zu Fu√ü. Verschiedene L√§den erreicht man schon in weniger als 200m. Die Metro ist ca 10 min zu Fu√ü entfernt. Die Unterkunft ist f√ºr 4 Personen perfekt geeignet. Das Doppelbett ist etwas klein und deshalb musste die 5. Person mit auf die Schlafcouch ausweichen. Die Schlafcouch war nicht im neusten Zustand. Die K√ºche war top. Das Bad ziemlich klein.
ID: 22367248_960674432541953549, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: This place is in a beautiful older building they appears to be mixed use of businesses and lodging.   It is very nicely decorated and charming and has a perfect location right in the center of the L‚ÄôExaimple district, where is is close to most tourist sights.  <br/>The walls are kind of thin, so it is easy to hear your neighbors and them to hear you at night, which is the only minor issue we had.  It was otherwise fantastic!

ID: 22665692_267966102, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The apartment is very convenient for the metro and for the Arc de Triumph yet is only about 10 minutes walk from the beaches and near to local laces to eat. The room is not large but it had everything I needed. The bathroom was clean and modern. There was a shared lounge area and balcony.  Rita was very friendly and helpful

ID: 2292917_1053470367948592678, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Monica was excellent and made getting into the apartment easy. The apartment is in a great location, but the apartment itself was a bit disappointing and needs investment. We wanted an extra bedroom so our two daughters could have extra space, but in retrospect we would have chosen a smaller 2-bedroom place that was better maintained. The third "bedroom" is more like a walk-in closet with two single beds so that wasn't very helpful. <br/>Every door and window frame has peeling paint, every white wall is marked from years of use and lack of maintenance. It was mostly clean, but the black stovetop was completely covered in dust, making us wonder what other things weren't cleaned that were not so obvious.<br/>We didn't spend too much time in it,  so we ended up giving it 3 stars. We don't like leaving reviews that are negative especially with a host that was so quick to respond...this was the last of three Airbnbs during our trip to three Spanish cities and we gave the other two 5 stars.

ID: 2293777_37223673, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Really nice way to spend a couple days. good neighbourhood that felt very "local" and safe with plenty of restaurants, convenience stores, bars and cafes nearby. Laia was really flexible. Would have been nice to know before booking that there was scaffolding and workmen outside, making the balcony was unusable, but she made up for it with a nice bottle of red which was a pleasant surprise on arrival.
ID: 2293777_906403343923352092, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The apartment was charming and well located but I was a little disappointed with the floor plan, the small TV with limited available channels, and the lack of the ability to play music.  Large issues with me and my needs but irrelevant to others.   Parking, shopping, sites, and dining is all nearby as well as a nice but noisy late night dive bar right outside the window.

ID: 2306489_21313417, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The check-in was very difficult because we arrived at 10 am and Vincent said the day before that check-in is only possible after 2pm so we had to hang around with our luggage in Barcelona. Then we called Vincet at 2pm and he said that the maid is still inside. We were allowed to bring our luggage in the flat but we had to go outside again because the maid had not finished the cleaning yet. So we were allowed to go in the appartement at 4pm. We could have taken a flight much later! The maid who gave us the keys was very drunk I think and not a very clean person. But the flat was very charming and we loved it! Very fashionable, cool and modern! 
<br/>On one day we had no electricity and we called Vincent but we had to fix the problem ourselves... Thank god one of us is electrician! 
<br/>On the day of the check out nobody informed us that the check out had to be before 12am, and then we wrote Vincent and he said that we had to pay extra if we want to stay longer (our flight home was at 9pm). So we had to carry our luggage everywhere in the city....
<br/>
<br/>Except these problems, it was a cool, clean place and we had everything we needed.

ID: 2306489_622234490382145740, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Vincent was a wonderful host. Extremely easy to get in contact with and answered all our  queries with no hesitation.

ID: 2307557_1026715412668327054, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Absolutely loved the Apartment in Barcelona,  it is open and spacious, perfectly appointed, lots of light and a terrific location.  Juanmi met us at the scheduled time, took us through all the details for the building and the apartment and shared his favorite restaurants, bars and "must see" locations.<br/>We were blown away by the views from the windows and specially from the bedroom.  The Apt was walking distance to the Gothic Quarter, Las Rambles and many shops and restaurants and Barcelona has a great taxi system with over 10k taxis roaming the streets so it was always easy to get anywhere else we wanted to go.<br/>The building was secure and has great elevators so moving in and out was very simple.<br/>We highly recommend this location and will always stay here on future trips to Barcelona
ID: 23088804_431914702, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Really enjoyed the stay at this cozy apartment room. The location is perfect as it is right above a central subway station and a supermarket is in the same house as well.

I had read reviews about the apartment being hard to locate and it looks like they have done nothing about that problem as there is a postcard sized sign with small writing with the apartment name. Please just rename your apartment to Jazz Apartments, it will save a lot of people time, including the hosts. Everything else was 10/10

ID: 2329405_250778177, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: This was our first experience of booking accommodation through Airbnb and communication from Lluis was excellent from confirming the booking, answering questions that we had in the lead up to the visit, through to meeting us at the apartment following a delayed flight. <br/>The apartment is comfortable, with everything that we needed as a party of five adults.  Access to the Metro is a five minute walk, as is La Rambla.  It is a great location for touring the city. <br/>The only note of caution that I would add is that if you are not used to living on a main road, the location of the apartment is at a major road junction and traffic noise is audible 24 hours a day.  We were woken a number of times by emergency service vehicles during our stay. <br/>Despite these disturbances, we enjoyed our stay at this apartment.

The subway is also right there to take you to all of the hot spots in the city in less than 10 minutes. The apartment was great for 2 couples, not a place to hang out at the apartment too much, but the location is unreal
ID: 23463004_583134340424148240, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Illacat's place was great. The views in the photos are accurate... When you step out onto the balcony, La Sagrada Familia is right there. The overall location was great. It's not particularly close to the main tourist neighborhood, the Gothic Quarter, but there were great restaurants nearby (including ones with outdoor seating just a few doors down, with La Sagrada Familia as the backdrop) and a subway stop right on the corner. We didn't find it to be too loud, though we could sometimes here people going up/down the stairs. Everything was clean, and the host seemed easily reachable (we communicated through WhatsApp for the check-in). Would recommend!

ID: 23511046_457879983, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Katia was an amazing host, helping us every step of the way and giving us great tips about local services we could use throughout our stay. She truly went above and beyond, helping us recover a missing bag that was lost before we checked in to the apartment.<br/>The apartment was clean, accommodating, and was close to several trains which made getting around town very easy. I would highly recommend staying here, as it is a great space where you can get away from the hustle and bustle of the city, but also get anywhere you need to go through public transportation.

ID: 2351233_631679298308870658, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The location of this apartment for first time Barcelona visitors was incredible.  Steps away from Gaudi designed homes, close to the start of la Rambla, incredible views of the city, and plentiful restaurants and markets nearby. Our host was gracious in helping us make our travels easy. Highly recommend this location.
ID: 2351233_637500437359087553, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Fantastic location‚Ä¶the host was very accommodating and communication was excellent. Very comfortable apartment, although some furniture/kitchen appliances showing their age with wear and tear (not sofa or bed). Although listing mentions a smart tv, I only saw digital channels and none in English. Bed very comfortable. Views were amazing. We are light sleepers and early to bed/early to rise and could hear the tv and conversations from the property next door as the bedroom is adjacent to the neighbouring property. But the noise did not go on for a long time. All in all a great host and great accommodation.

The apartment itself is in a very convenient location‚Äîyou‚Äôll be able to go anywhere with ease. We enjoyed staying at Angel‚Äôs apartment and would recommend it to anyone looking to book an Airbnb in the Sant Antoni neighbourhood.
ID: 23638419_612954307, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Great location, very close to Sagrada Familia. Kitchen was fully equipped with silverware/pots/pans so we got to cook. Beds and bathroom were clean.

ID: 2368976_332820455, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Paola was a fantastic host. She made check in quick and easy and was very informative about the area. She made it clear she would be available for anything we needed during our stay which was much appreciated. The space is on the 5th floor of an apartment building but there is an elevator so getting to the room is no problem. The apartment felt very European and Spanish which is exactly what we wanted. The location was also great. Less than a 10 minute walk up Rambla de Pouble Nou to a beautiful beach. And the walk itself is fun as there is plenty of restaurants and such on this street. We loved our stay and would do it again if we are ever lucky enough to visit Barcelona in the future!

ID: 23990630_1186902286517538702, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: I booked and paid for this place on in July 2023, for a check in June 2024, 2 days prior the host acted like they didn‚Äôt know me.  They had double booked the place. Less than helpful in assuring me that I would have the place available.  It took multiple calls and a ton of stress to air bnb to get it straightened out.  Problem it was formula 1 weekend in Barcelona and a major festival, there were no rooms available anywhere for less than $1000 a night.  I spent the day prior to check in stressing out, as I had already flown to Europe from the U.S.   Add in my girlfriend balling her eyes out for a day because of this‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt add up to a pleasant pre check in experience.  Very stressful.  The place is nice, clean, great having a washer and very secure building.   Las ramblas is a very busy street and loaded with pickpockets and scammers all day and night. Place was nice, but I think a block or two over or even in the area of Barceloneta iis a better option for couples or anyone with kids

My husband and I stayed there while on our Honeymoon and they couldn‚Äôt have made a better stay for us.  They had great advice for local scenes, had a wonderful location that was close or easily accessible to the sites and sounds of the city, and made us feel like we were staying with family!
ID: 24011492_272122299, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: What an amazing stay at Juan‚Äôs apartment in Barcelona!! The location cannot be beat. It is one block off the middle of La Rambla on a quiet side street. This was great for me as a light sleeper because it was very quiet at night, yet you are so close to the busy and fantastic La Rambla. Juan was at the apartment when we checked in and offered to help carry our luggage upstairs to his apartment. You do need to climb a number of stairs to his apartment. There is no elevator. It‚Äôs a great way to burn some calories from all the tapas you will eat. Once inside, Juan sat down with us and made sure we were comfortable with everything. He also provided lots of recommendations and gave us an itinerary that he thought we would like before leaving. The apartment was very nice. Open windows let in the cool Mediterranean air at night. The space was clean. The shower was nice and wide with plenty of hot water. The bed was comfortable and we slept great. Our experience was fantastic and we highly recommend this to anyone, as long as you are okay with climbing a few stairs. Thanks!
ID: 24032849_441563126, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The apartment is in an incredible location.  In the dead center of El Born neighborhood, there are amazing restaurants, bars, and shopping right outside the door.  Yanina is very warm and inviting and sharing the space with her was a pleasure.  She gave excellent recommendations, was very hospitable and made us feel very at home.  An added plus is a rooftop which was a great space to relax before a night out.

ID: 2412835_504805849, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: We LOVED staying at this Barcelona penthouse! The space is beautiful, stylish and immaculately clean. We wanted to stay in a neighborhood that was out of the main tourist hustle and bustle, while still getting a feel for daily life in the city and this apartment fit the bill perfectly. Being on the border of Gracia, Eixample and Galvany, this place is in an ideal location and from here, we were able to explore city on foot and bike. There are so many great restaurants, tapas bars and pla√ßas nearby! One of our favorite days here included walking to the Mercat de Galvany to get some wonderful cheeses, then enjoying them later that day on the rooftop terrace with some local wine and bread from a nearby bakery. This apartment is a true gem and we can't wait to return!

Theres the whole of downtown to left and the sea that you can't see in the picture and a partial view of a soccer field to the right where children play soccer on the weekends. Gr√†ciais a 10 minute walk for the apartment and ended up as being one of are favorite places to go. Their services are amazing. We met in the apartment and the host gave us a run down of the city, places to go, bus routes, they left wine and snack which was amazing from our long flight. There are 2 train stations that are close which take you anywhere in the city. The place was big, love the kitchen, clean and open with the view of the city. Great place overall, This place made the trip quite special.

The free parking space provided in the building was a big plus for us, as we rented a car for our Spain trip.  Check in was easy. I judge this apartment to be in a highly recommended location, if you don't want to be around the crowds of tourists near central Barcelona.

ID: 2491989_115941194, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Susana was a fantastic host. She greeted us at the apartment and provided us a great tour of the place.  With it being our first time in Barcelona, she was very generous in pointing out local restaurants/tapas places, public transportation locations, and nightlife options for us. We were only there for two nights and did not have to contact her a single time as she provided us with everything we needed to enjoy our stay.
<br/>
<br/>The Apartment is located in a residential, quiet, and great location. You're not deep in the touristy & popular places in the city, and this makes you feel like you're one of the locals. The apartment was clean, comfortable & much more than what my father and I needed for our stay. We came in the winter so we didn't use the huge patio, but definitely would have if it were sunny and warm. The apt had extra blankets, toiletries, espresso machine (she just installed :) ), all were fantastic.  The only thing I would say is that the place is not modern/flashy in anyway, and some of the ammenities (tv, outlets) are a bit old. But, that didn't bother us at all.
<br/>
<br/>In a new country/city, it's always good to have a great place to sleep at night, and Susana's place was the perfect place to feel local in a big city like Barcelona.  It's affordable and perfect for couples & small groups. Will be back the next time I'm in Barcelona!

It was located in a beautiful, safe, and quaint little part of the city and extremely walkable to various restaurants, shops, bars, parks, sites such as La Sagrada Familia and other Antoni Gaudi architecture, and even the beach! Jaume was an excellent host, responsive, and accommodating. Grateful to Jaume for sharing his space! Would definitely stay here again.
ID: 25528952_619791933, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: My girlfriend and I stayed here for 32 nights and found it to be a lovely and stylish apartment with good utilities. The location is perfect. So close to the beach and only a short walk into the city centre as well! Communication with the host was good. You can message them on WhatsApp and they will reply very quickly.

ID: 2557934_34049356, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: A reasonable base for our week in Barcelona. Silvia was very organised with instructions for our arrival. She welcomed us with a bottle of wine and shared some of her city tips with us. The location of the flat was decent - we pretty much manage to walk everywhere and the Metro was nearby for when we didn't. There are some nice places to eat and drink nearby too. The flat itself was clean and tidy. However, we found the bathroom an unpleasant experience - the shower could do with modernising and the water temperature was very erratic. In the bedroom it's a noisy bed with sheets that have seen better days. To be honest, despite Silvia being lovely, I'd look for somewhere else to stay when we revisit Barcelona.

ID: 25702608_500499059557305750, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The reason why we didn‚Äôt put 5 stars is due to the fact that there were details missing that made the stay less pleasant. First let‚Äôs go for the pros and then the cons.<br/>Pros.<br/>1. Well located <br/>2. Clean <br/>3. As the pictures show.<br/>4. Easy access <br/>5. Facilities around<br/>6. Nice pillows <br/>Cons <br/>1. I don‚Äôt like places where soap and shampoo are strictly rationed. One small bottle of 25 ml of shampoo and shower gel for two days for two guests falls short. <br/>2. The fridge makes very loud noises that do not allow a good sleep. As it‚Äôs a loft, there are no doors between kitchen and bedroom. Therefore, a pair of ear plugs are recommended. <br/>3. Kitchen lacks of cleaning cloths/paper.<br/>Maybe these are details but that‚Äôs me and my friends‚Äô honest report.

The apartment never really got too hot for us, they provided us with some fans that circulated the air very well throughout the day and night. Literally a 1 minute walk from a busy street FULL of tapas restaurants and short walking distances from both the metro and Las Ramblas. We walked everywhere from here! Hosts were also very helpful and very kind. Would come again!

ID: 2600907_88772612, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Yvonne was a wonderful host. Everything was set up perfectly, and it made for a smooth trip. The neighborhood is in a perfect location. It is easy to walk to everything you'd like to see, but it isn't in the touristy area. Therefore you can easily enjoy all that Barcelona, but still have a nice quiet place to go back to. The area has a wonderful local feel to it that makes it feel as if you really are "living" in Barcelona. I would most certainly stay here again.

ID: 2634227_132743579, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Lovely stay. Nice flat. Francesc was waiting outside the flat when we arrived late in the dark and spent lots of time with us giving tips on the flat and local area. The flat was clean, had everything we needed and a nice sunny balcony in the morning. Despite being in a big city the flat is pretty quiet; a little bit of noise from surrounding neighbours above. Also beds on the firm side but otherwise great. <br/>When time to leave Francesc dropped us off at the local train station which saved a lot of hassle. Thank you!

We were met at the exact time we had planned at her apartment and were shown all the amenities including working instructions for the appliances(all of them new), the cable TV and had a complete walk through the apartment. It was clean, modern and very spacious for the four of us. The location was ideal for exploring the areas we wanted to visit which included Las Ramblas, the gothic quarter, Sagrada Familia, Montjuic fountain and countless other areas. We were able to walk to all of these sites which gave us great freedom throughout our stay. Mar was also able to direct us to restaurants within a few blocks of the apartment that were all very good and she kept in touch with us throughout our stay. Thankyou Mar for adding to a fantastic trip to Barcelona.

She personally welcomed us at check-in and provided detailed information about the neighborhood, along with a helpful map highlighting local restaurants and supermarkets. Her home was one of the best Airbnbs we've stayed in. The two bedrooms allowed us to have separate spaces from our kids, and the extra toilet was very convenient. The variety of shampoo options was a nice touch. The washer and dryer were a lifesaver, especially in the hot and humid weather. The central air conditioning kept us cool after long days exploring the city. Although it's in a less touristy area, the bus stop is right in front of the building, and the metro is just a few minutes away. The apartment is quite spacious, and the kitchen is fully equipped for cooking breakfast, lunch, and dinner. There's plenty of hooks and storage space for clothes, backpacks, and jackets. Barbara even left us a box of ice cream in the freezer and a generous supply of coffee pods.

ID: 2776901_154786889, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Fantastic clean, bright modern apartment, in a perfect location in the centre of Barcelona. Juan was a great host, communication with him was excellent, and he was there to meet us personally upon our arrival. We travelled as a family of four, with our trip being a surprise gift from our son. Shortly after he had booked the flights, my wife fell and sustained a broken ankle and was fitted with a none weight bearing cast, therefore was going to be dependent on both a wheelchair and crutches during our trip . She did not want to cancel the trip as our son had also booked football tickets for Barca's last home game of the season. This left us with a short space of time to find suitable accommodation with wheelchair access, as my wife didn't feel confident to use crutches on stairs. Juan was very helpful and assured us that my wife would be okay, as there was a special wheelchair lift to take her up the stairs to access the lift to reach the third floor where the apartment was. The master bedroom has en suite facilities, and both bathrooms were exceptionally clean with large enclosed showers and a plentiful supply of hot water. The towels and bedlinen were of good quality and there was also a hairdryer for guests use.  We didn't make use of any of the kitchen facilities other than the fridge to put drinks in, but Juan showed us how things worked should we have wanted to. Again everything looked clean and modern in that area.  Even without needing wheelchair access, we would have no hesitation in booking this apartment again due to the location and cleanliness of it. Many thanks Juan for accommodating us at short notice, and we hope to visit Barcelona and your apartment again.

The bedrooms were tranquil and comfortable, with high-quality linens ensuring a restful night's sleep.

You could stay there for the entire stay and you would get to experience a great deal of Barcelona, its people, and the culture. I cannot imagine staying anywhere else on a future trip to Barcelona.

The apartment is very spacious, perfect for one or two couples, the photos do not the the apartment any justice. Great facilities and information provided in the apartment.

ID: 28830732_647624549237076416, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: our family stayed at Herminia‚Äôs airBNB for a total of 9 nights, during the Primavera Festival.  the apartment is really nice, with almost entirely new furnishings/appliances, boasting a view of the library & park from a pair of nice little verandas, and well located in a good, safe part of town with many amenities nearby (and good proximity to the metro).<br/>we found the place to be a good size for 3, though (as some reviews have noted) the pull-out sofa isn‚Äôt really as much a bed as a modular sofa that pulls out to resemble the size of a bed.  we had this exact piece of furniture at home, and it does have an issue w/ one piece not attaching well at the base ‚Äî which allows it to ‚Äúdrift‚Äù in the night.  and it‚Äôs not nearly padded enough to allow a good night‚Äôs sleep.  so a duvet was necessary, and like one other reviewer we had quite a time trying to find it (after being assured it was on-site) ‚Äî turns out there‚Äôs a hidden shelving unit in the wall btw the entrance & bedroom.  unfortunately there was no such instruction about that, nor were we told exactly where to find it, so we lost a day looking.<br/>the responsiveness from the host was quick ‚Äî but more up-front information like the above would have been appreciated and spared us some frustration.  and we would have also appreciated their providing some very basic items.  it was a long day of travel for us before we checked in, only to find 1 bathtowel, one coin-sized bar of soap, 1 full roll of toilet tissue, and no detergent pods ‚Äî for a family of 3, over 9 days.  these are cheap & reasonable items to expect for a rental of this price, and they‚Äôre basics that all other hosts on our trip provided, without having to request.  instead, we went shopping.  move-in readiness is pretty crucial to me, as it is to many long-distance travelers.  this is the only point on which i would say this residence is of a lesser overall value.<br/>most importantly, there were a couple issues of personal safety that should have been expressly stated, that were not.  for one, the stovetop is electronic, and if you fail to notice that‚Äôs activated, and brush it with a wet hand, you‚Äôll feel an electric current that‚Äôs mildly ‚Äúshocking‚Äù (cautionary note for parents).  also, the door has an elaborate locking mechanism that requires the key to open it from the INSIDE.  which means if you happen to have only one key (as we did when we checked in), and one of your party leaves with it, anyone in the apartment is quite literally TRAPPED INSIDE.  this strikes me as a major fire hazard, though it could prove a problem for any number of other reasons.  (i was pretty incredulous to hear management express surprise at that, when i first reported the issue)  bottom line: be sure to request additional key(s) in advance ‚Äî especially since they must be retrieved from another location, which has limited daily hours.<br/>generally clean, though the floor had clearly not been done.  and we were unable to cite this upon check-in, as the smartcode for the check-in service was non-operational.<br/>all in all, a great stay.  but one that was not without its bumps.

Right next to la Rambla where all shops and restaurants are located. Very good communication with the Hosts. I was having a package sent to this address and Maurizio was very helpful in trying to track it down for me. Was unaware before booking about how many people we were going to be sharing the apartment with which ended up being two other room with couples in each room. Everything worked out well and we were able to come and go without any problems with other roommates. Would definitely stay here again or recommend anyone trying to look for a place to stay in Barcelona.

While we didn't feel good when our checking in, the apartment is not ready, as per talking by the checking manager Jennifer, it is because of the house cleaner is sick these days.

The entire apartment can accommodate four people completely. The service is also excellent! I checked out by myself at 6 o'clock that morning because my flight was cancelled and I failed to rebook the all night. I thought I needed to go to the airport to resolve it. As a result, as soon as I left the gate downstairs, I received a notification that my flight had been successfully changed. Because it's an afternoon flight, I want to go back to the apartment and rest for a while. But I had already drop the room card inside the box. I am very grateful to the man who was on duty 24 Hour. He help me how to go inside the apartment without room card, gave me time to rest. If I back to Barcelona next time, I must rebook Eric again!

I traveled with 3 friends to Barcelona and we were allowed to check in early, and even after check out without hesitation we‚Äôre allowed to use his lockers.  Without question will stay there again.  Chamel who helped us check in also brought us complimentary snacks and coffee right before she left.  No better value for location and amenities.  You‚Äôd be silly not to stay here!

ID: 30762924_950618445248717054, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: My roommate and I stayed at this apartment for a month, and it was great. The location is wonderful‚Äî just a few steps from Placa George Orwell, in a lively, touristy neighborhood, about 7 minutes‚Äô walk from the L3 and L4 subways. The apartment is on the 6th (top) floor, facing the interior of the block, so it is quiet and gets good sunlight. The balcony faces the courtyard and is delightful. <br/>The two bedrooms are significantly different sizes‚Äî one is large enough for closets and a dresser, and one is cozy with just a bed and armoire. Each has a window. Both bedrooms and the main living space are air conditioned, which gets plenty cold even in the summer heat. <br/>The kitchen is well-stocked with pots and pans, utensils, appliances (microwave, kettle, sandwich press), and two mini fridges (but no large freezer). The clothes washer is effective, and there are lines for drying clothes on the balcony. <br/>Overall it was a lovely place to stay for a long-term stay, and I‚Äôd happily stay again.
ID: 30787688_811468796520642750, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Excellent stay and enjoyed the place. Alejandro was very responsive and helpful. We liked the location too- not too far from all the main tourist sites but still a unique neighborhood. One small recommendation is to make sure you have cellular data available on your phone to access the digital lock. It‚Äôs our own fault but we did not have that yet - fortunately Alejandro came in 15 min to let us in.

ID: 30925813_978130302114078878, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Apartment was very nice and spacious.  Beds were comfortable.  Perfect walking distance to places we needed to go.<br/>Only big gripe & regret was the large ugly kitchen stain in the wooden floor.  It was not shown in the photos.  It looked gross.  Would not have rented because of it. <br/>Second gripe was the loud motorcycle noise.  Apartment is close to a traffic light so motorcycle constantly stop and accelerate.  Difficulty sleeping during the afternoon after 8 hour overnight flight.  <br/>Third gripe was behind the toilet there were a few missing wall tiles.  While small it  was noticeable.  stood out from the rather nice bathroom.<br/>Fourth gripe was the living room AC.  The vent rattled as it moved and condensation splashed a bit over the floor.  Possible culprit to the nearby kitchen floor damage.  Managed to find setting to keep vent from moving.  <br/>Last gripe was the constant very small flies.  Looked like fruit flies.  They were there since we arrived before we brought any groceries.

You're very close to the funicular to the castle, 30 minute walk or less to the Ramblas and gothic quarter. If you want to get around town to further locations or don't want to walk as much, use the Cabify app which was very affordable. The neighborhood itself was wonderful, quiet, cozy, clean, very safe.

ID: 31550517_425802275839948223, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Onix is friendly, good welcoming and responsive. <br/>Cons (-): Flat's decoration is pretty outdated, and furniture isn't corresponding to the price 180/night . In particular the dirty  sofa has lots of stains, is very uncomfortable, it stinks, you just don't want to sit on it, not to say out of question for sleeping in it! Roof terrace is unusable (steep stair, no shading nor enough furniture nor pillows) and the other lacks outside pillows for the chairs. It could be possible to be hidden from neighbours direct view into the whole terrace and flat with some well-placed plants.<br/>East-oriented bedroom windows don't have shutters, and inside curtains are too narrow, so you wake up every day at 4am, that's annoying.<br/>Pros (+): The apartment is well equipped with everything you can need, one can see it has been used to live for real. Localization is central, restaurants, supermarket, quiet neighbourhood. Lots of natural light, and natural air. One of the terrace at the same level of the apartment is very appreciable.<br/>All-in-one: OK for less than 100‚Ç¨/night or it should be fully renovated and refurbished. High-season cannot be the only reason to rise a price.

The terrace is great as is a cozy reading nook upstairs. Esther‚Äôs assistant Laura was incredibly helpful. Would def stay again.

The apartment itself is a good size and well kept. We had a very enjoyable stay and would definitely look to book this spot again when we return to Barcelona! Great and helpful host too. Highly recommend!
ID: 3189694_531343653, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: We found this to be a great apartment with plenty of bars just one street down. Mani mini marts in the area also. We walked to most things we wanted to see. 15min walk to la Rambla. We felt safe in the area.

ID: 32096193_623726840375285559, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Fantastic open space & location for restaurants, bars, city & beach! Josie the host was available to communicate with & responded very promptly during our stay.<br/>Sadly our stay was tainted by the pianist in the apartment above who played 9am intermittently some days until midnight. This music was relentless & frustrating considering we chose the space so we could work remotely in peace & before arriving, actually agreed to no loud noise as requested by the host.<br/>Josie has mentioned adding some sound proofing but if you are considering travelling with a young family (which we are not), please watch out. Also no oven and dishwasher doesn‚Äôt work.

ID: 3219190_902035085665588374, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Let me start off by saying, Barbara is an incredible host. She met us at her beautiful apartment, that btw looks absolutely incredible. She checked us in, made us feel at home, gave us recommendations, and allowed us to leave our bags despite the early check out. The home looks  beautiful-high ceilings, incredibly comfortable beds, great balconies over the street and a quaint terrace in the back. Wish I stayed here on my first trip to Barca !
ID: 32200318_582423900218575522, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Very good location. Spacious appartement. <br/>Only 1 bathroom and toilet which is a bit complicated at 4, but everything else was good!
ID: 32207394_1102829320186543752, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Overall this was a really lovely place to stay for three days. It‚Äôs in a great part of the city, with an easy walk to Sagrada (about 0.8mi) and an uphill but pleasant walk to Park Guell (1.3mi). You‚Äôre very close to La Rambla, but also many fascinating side streets that are not covered in Gucci and Balenciaga stores. The apartment is a bit more worn-in than the photos look, with lots of wear on the cabinets and bathroom/shower appliances. That was a surprise as the photos make everything look brand new.

ID: 32704893_553442903548966598, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Incredible location right in the middle of some very cool bars, restaurants and coffee shops, there is also an Aldi a few minutes away for grocery shopping.  Being in the middle of everything did mean that it can get a little loud on the street outside at night, however this never stopped us from being able to sleep.<br/>The room did feel a little cold at times, however there is a heater so again this wasn't too much of an issue.<br/>Check in and out processes were both smooth, great communication from Deco, dealt with my query about a power cut quickly and efficiently.<br/>Would definitely recommend a stay here, will certainly consider using again if I return to Barcelona.

ID: 3281769_281597846, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Beautiful and spacious apartment with quality furnishings and good facilities.  Photographs don't really show how good the apartment is.  The lighting is very stylish maybe a little dim for some but we loved it.    The location is outstanding with easy access on foot or by Metro (1 minute walk) to all of Barcelona's attractions.  Good WiFi, Smart TV, fully equipped kitchen etc.   Having only one set of keys was inconvenient but expect these will be replaced soon, an earlier guest lost the second set.  Kitchen has dishwasher, induction hob, full size fridge freezer and the cutlery and tableware are all good quality.  We found no issues with cleanliness, the place was spotlessly clean albeit there  was some minor mould in the en suite shower.  We highly recommend this apartment and  will consider renting again when we return to Barcelona.

Fiona met us when we checked in, gave exact and clear instruction for checking in, a quick tour of the apt and us feel right at home away home.  One of the best host we met in our about 10 years AirBnB experience.  Location is great as it is walkable to most of the attractions, some of the best restaurants in Barcelona are 10-20 mins walk away, and hosts have some great recommendations too.  5 stars all the way and we will be back next time visiting Barca.

Room is small, yet very comfortable and very pleasant. Neighborhood and surroundings are laden with restaurants, shops, bars, supermarkets and attractions ‚Äì yet at the same time peaceful and 'untouristy'.  Also, couldn't ask for a better host. Lee is welcoming, knowledgeable, and simultaneously available for queries yet respectful of privacy. Very cool host, very nice place to spend some time in Barcelona and highly recommended.

The room was small but very clean and was a perfect size for the two of us. The apartment has another room for rent, and is spacious. We were close to most things we wanted to see, all within a 20 minute walk. The area felt extremely safe, even past midnight. Several restaurants and supermarkets within a 5-10 minute walk.

ID: 33185850_604450530, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Holger and Iker were prompt and amazing hosts! The place was enormous with old Spanish architecture which gave the place a rustic vibe. The location was extremely central, right by Plaza de Catalunya and right across the University of Barcelona. The A1 or A2 bus from the airport drops you right outside of the address and is near any method of public transportation.<br/>Aside from the place, Holger and Iker were extremely flexible! They allowed us to check in earlier than expected as well as store as bags to explore the city for our last few hours as we had a late evening flight. I would love to come back here as it was a great place for a big group!

ID: 3350190_570870646142071823, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Alex's apartment is in a sweet old building and it has been thoughtfully restored and tastefully decorated.  The apartment is in a central part of Barcelona, within walking distance to many desirable neighborhoods and is a short walk from the airport bus line.  Though it is downtown, it is quiet as the building is not very big and the street-side windows have been doubled-up to cancel out the noise.  In addition, Alex is very helpful with travel guidance and local recommendations.  We really enjoyed our stay here.
ID: 3350190_90549153, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Alex was exceptional! I have had some really good hosts in the past but he takes hosting to another level. Alex is extremely organised and is flexible to meet your need whenever he can. The apartment is perhaps better than the pictures and perfectly located near amazing bars and restaurants, all of which Alex provides a guide for. He was extremely accommodating and even helped me plan a dinner for my friends. An amazing host with an incredible apartment. 
ID: 33599824_529008820, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Hector and Lupes place is in the heart of the gothic quarter, close to la ramblas and the beach. Honestly, you cannot find a better located place if visiting Barcelona! The place is clean and has all the amenities needed. Hector and Lupe are amazing hosts as they respected our privacy, gave us many tips and suggestions, and provided us with many extra amenities during our stay. Definitely recommend staying here if you would like to be close to it all in Barcelona

ID: 33764163_584468812, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: It was such an easy and hassle free experience for us that we felt like we were staying in a hotel.  There were no hidden surprises, nothing was broken or difficult to operate.  Comfortable bed, plenty of hot water, nice bathroom, spacious, calm and quiet, well insulated,  no problems with it being too stuffy, hot, cold, etc.<br/>I loved the neighborhood, you can find (non-touristy) local markets, pharmacy, tapas within a 3-5 min walk.  It is a safe, more mature, neighborhood and locals are very friendly.  <br/>You can easily walk to La Sagrada and the Arc D‚ÄôTriomph/Citadel Park from here.  If you do, notice how touristy the shops become the closer you get to the attraction. This made me want to explore our local neighborhood even more to find  affordable food and drinks.  <br/>Catching a cab is unbelievably easy, two minutes at the most.  Which we needed to do to visit Parc G√ºell, La Rambla and the Gothic Quarter.
ID: 33764163_608680511, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Great customer service. We had told them our flight landed at 10 but check-in was at 2. They cleaned and had our room available by 11.

She waited up for me, feed me, and even found a pair for shorts for me to wear the next day while I waited for my suitcase. Jana was a great source of information, about where to go and what to see, and also about some of the stories and histories of places and people.

Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt have the best weather during my days at Barcelona, but this location is unbeatable. Once you know know to move around either by bus, metro, our tour bus it‚Äôs easy to go everywhere in Barcelona.<br/>The TV is a bit small but I guess coming from the US it‚Äôs hard to beat our screen sizes. The Heater/AC works great so you can be comfortable inside even though the weather outside is not good. The apartment was well stocked and even provided some detergent for a quick laundry load. If you are planning to go to the Camp Nou the metro is literally a 5 minute walk from the Airbnb.
ID: 34134281_1033986598157662061, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Fantastic quiet central location, very close to the metro and even a couple of supermarkets were within a couple of minutes walk. We loved the accommodation and the cleanliness and safety. <br/>There was nothing at fault and we felt that it suited us much better than a hotel. The host was very friendly and checking in couldn‚Äôt have been any more pleasant or simpler.
ID: 34162126_789734228572541314, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: I highly recommend. I don't usually do hostels, however this was a good place to meet people and the inside was clean and aesthetically pleasing. The beds had good shades to prevent the light from coming into your bed, and a light within your own bed that was good. I he Christmas here and we did a dinner together, which the staff did an amazing job. highly recommend!

Two things to note: <br/>* I did have trouble finding the place - Airbnb and Google led me somewhere that was a couple blocks away from the actual apartment. <br/>* Street noise was an issue for me one of the two nights I stayed there. I think trash pickup happened at 3am on Thursday. Friday night was great though.

The room was also very chill and all facilities were great. I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else on my next visit to Barcelona. Nora was also the greatest host and she made me feel at home right away!
ID: 34552880_641044678929365585, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: we spent 5 nights at Jordi's airBNB in the Gracia district, and it was a wonderful stay.  cool even without the use of the AC, plenty of sunlight & breeze through the open veranda & windows.  the beds were comfortable, the kitchen was well stocked, laundry worked just fine, and the place felt spacious, well maintained & clean.  there was even a good supply of bath towels, toilet tissue, laundry/dishwasher detergent, and a bottle of champagne waiting for us.  wifi worked (for all 3 of us) w/out issue. only hitch -- the stairs.  many of these older buildings don't have a lift, but that's the way it is.  once you're there, you'll be very happy.  we'd rent it again in a heartbeat.

ID: 34957866_867900924203652086, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: A beautiful apartment overlooking a bustling little plaza in Barcelona. Andre was a great host and very easy to communicate with. Poble Sec is a perfect location in Barcelona, removed from the mania of the main tourist destinations but with all amenities and things to do but within walking distance of the tourist sites if that is your scene. We had a great time and would recommend this apartment and area to anyone, anytime.
ID: 3496888_253025109, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Great location-  20 minutes walk  to beach and Las Ramblas. 15 min to La Sagrida Familia. Metro stop around corner. Supermarkets and bakeries nearby. Housekeeper was very helpful and responded swiftly to queries. Host booked taxi to and from airport which was helpful. The only draw back was street noise but this is to be expected in central Barcelona. Twin bedrooms more suitable for children than adults as quite small.<br/>Overall a great stay.

ID: 35121401_558078122, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Un mes bastante bueno en este alojamiento, donde puedes ir a tu aire y sin molestias. Es un lugar habilitado para esto, y la casa es enorme. El sal√≥n-comedor es muy espacioso, la cocina ten√≠a todo lo necesario tambi√©n. La habitaci√≥n est√° bastante bien, y la relaci√≥n calidad/precio es perfecta. La cama tiene un somier el√©ctrico de estos con la opci√≥n de regularlo para que suba o baje las partes de arriba y abajo, ideal para ponerse c√≥modo viendo una serie. El armario es muy espacioso tambi√©n, y el ba√±o privado por habitaci√≥n me toc√≥ justo al lado de mi puerta, para el cual te dan una llave junto a la de la habitaci√≥n, y la de la casa y el portal. Muy hospitalario el trato de los anfitriones y muy amables, destaco a Evelyn ya que es con la que sol√≠a tener m√°s contacto y a la que m√°s sol√≠a ver. La secadora es un puntazo la verdad, y la terraza es bastante grande y est√° incre√≠ble para relajarte, escuchar m√∫sica, leer, ver alguna serie o simplemente relajarte. Destaco el punto tambi√©n de que no tuve ning√∫n problema respecto al fumar, lo cual llega a ser imprescindible si se es fumador y es una larga estancia para estar c√≥modo (obviamente en habitaci√≥n y terraza, por sentido com√∫n). El barrio era tranquilo, hab√≠an algunas peque√±as tiendas y fruter√≠as cerca y un Mercadona unas calles m√°s abajo, adem√°s de que est√° cerca de la carretera central con varias cafeter√≠as, tiendas y supermercados. Obviamente tambi√©n el metro, a menos de 10 minutos caminando desde la casa el que va a Barcelona centro. Poco m√°s que decir, encantado con este mes all√≠ y la experiencia, y repetir√≠a sin duda. Lo recomendar√≠a totalmente.

Metro stop close by, short walk to Las Ramblas, store across the street, breakfast place downstairs.  Elevator is rather small though and has a weight limit.  Only 2 of us could ride at a time.
ID: 3535864_894773527747388056, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: All the previous reviews are accurate. This is probably the best location in Barcelona. Almost all the big sights and great restaurants are a walkable distance. And there‚Äôs a Metro station right there if you want to use Barcelona‚Äôs great Metro system to get around. Best of all, the room is peaceful and quiet - just what I needed after a big day of enjoying Barcelona.  Edu checked in every day to make sure all was going well. And he had wonderful restaurant recommendations.  Everything was top notch.

ID: 3567993_435030900, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The location was very nice and very centrally located.  There was a good grocery store right across the street and the apartment seemed very safe.<br/>However, there were a number of problems.  First, the wireless internet was so slow at times we couldn't even send out e-mails at times and my laptop computer couldn't even get a connection that functioned.  We called the owner, and he said that we should go down to the first floor of the building from our apartment on the 6th floor to get better wireless internet connection.  This is unacceptable.  <br/>Second, there was only one mug, one wine glass and there were no cereal bowls in the apartment.  I used a serving bowl for my morning cereal.  Also the hair dryer didn't blow hot air.<br/>Because of the poor internet connection (worse than an airport internet connection) we probably wouldn't stay at this apartment again since we rely on the internet to e-mail and communicate with our friends and family back home.  If the internet problem was fixed, then I would recommend the apartment to others.
ID: 3586637_17952199, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: About the flat: the flat itself was very satisfying, equipped with all the amenities you may need during a holidays stay. Both beds were very comfortable, and the terrace was a massive bonus (having meals outside was amazing!). The location of the flat, while not ideal in terms of proximity to the beach, clubs etc, was great in terms of amenities (several groceries stores nearby, including a large one) and is well connected with public transit (bus stops all around, and a metro station less than a 3min walk away - it is easy to get to the beach in less than 25min). The "un-central" location also meant that the street was very calm in the evenings, which is always enjoyable.<br/>Overall I highly recommend this flat for a holidays stay!<br/>About Sandro: Sandro was an incredible host. The first good surprise was that he offered to pick us up from the airport (for a reasonable fee) with our names on a piece of paper to make it easy to find each other (he also offered the same service at checkout!). Sandro was also very helpful throughout our stay, always responding to my messages within a few hours. He was also very accomodating at checkout, allowing us to leave our luggage in the flat beyond checkout until he drove us to the airport a few hours later.<br/>Our overall experience was very positive, and we have already decided that, should we go back to Barcelona for another holidays (very likely!), we will book accomodation with Sandro.<br/>Highly recommended!
ID: 3586637_278004806, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: A lovely little apartment and a nice quiet area of Barcelona, away from the main tourist area. <br/>There are plenty local shops and is just a 2 minute walk to an L4 metro and a 20min walk from Parc G√ºell, La Pedrera/Passeig de Gr√†cia and La Sagrada Familia and an L3 metro. <br/>The apartment features well needed air con but if you like sunbathing, the balcony is a nice sun trap, having sun for most of the day. <br/>The kitchen is well supplied (except food of course) and there are several small supermarkets (eg Lidl, Dia) and independent fruit/veg stores/bakeries etc if you like to stay in and cook your own food with local ingredients. <br/>If we came back to Barcelona, we‚Äôd hope to stay here again. 
ID: 3586637_62970324, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Wow, what a perfect host and a perfect place to spend out ten days in Barcelona. Sandro arranged for a driver to pick us up at the airport and greeted us with a full tour of the apartment and how everything worked. Sandro was very polite, efficient and professional in his orientation. The best thing is everything looked even better then the pictures, the flat was perfect for the four of us! The front and or back terraces were awesome for a glass of wine after a busy day or coffee in the morning, the beds were beautiful, the kitchen was very functional. What we soon realized is the Gracia district was the perfect choice for us. It had restaurants on every street, bakeries, grocery stores, and of course some quite little bars as well. It was peaceful however and not as busy as some of the surrounding areas like El Born, Gottic etc. We felt very safe at night with many people out walking every evening going to restaurants. The other sweet spot was the subway station was very close to our apartment and we used it everyday. It was super efficient and easy to use and made all our daily excursions easy. All in all The host Sandro, the apartment, and the area were perfect. We had a great vacation in Spain and Sandro even arranged tickets for us to a FCBarcelona game! what an experience.

Further  extension for 3 nights  i did via abnb came in at $Cdn55/ night. So do not extend  your stayviia the reception  desk.<br/>There should be a rule that no large suitcases be allowed  in the room as it takes up what little  space there is. Also,  no "guests" be allowed in the room as was the case in mine.<br/>Additionally,  prepare yo wait gir the elevators.....thry are realllllllly  slow!

Location was absolutely perfect ‚Äì walkable to hundreds of restaurants and stores and all the wonderful things in Barcelona. The apartment was beautiful and historic and had a wonderful balcony overlooking the street below. The check-in was a little confusing, and the host was unresponsive, which required that we waited for over 30 minutes to get inside, but once that was resolved, we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place to anybody staying in Barcelona.

ID: 36504978_610815152, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: I specifically asked Marta+Paul if there was any noisy construction going in the area.  There was noisy construction on the other side of the wall of the apartment everyday.<br/>drilling, hammering, sawing, jack hammering, etc.  I have pictures of the men working and the construction.  Marta+Paul pretended like they did not know about it.  It is impossible to not know. You can touch the scaffolding when you go through the front door.  I have pictures if anyone wants to see them.<br/>Needless to say it was very irritating to have this go on all day while you are trying to relax and work.   I am very disappointed the Marta+Paul's deception.  The whole building is under renovation for another 6 months.  I would not recommend you stay until after 6 months at least.    I complained about their deception and they offered to move me to an adjacent apartment on the last day of my week stay.  Not helpful LOL<br/>Other than this, the apartment inside is fine.

What a pleasure! <br/>I have been using Airbnb for 5 years when overseas, and this was by far the best experience! They are excellent hosts. You have a big room and private walk in closet. Also a big and clean bathroom right outside the door. The kitchen is fantastic and you have everything you need. The location is perfect. Steps from the metro and walking right to Placa Catalunya! Don't forget the most beautiful and friendly dog in Barcelona, Eros! HIGHLY recommend!<br/>-----<br/>¬°GUAUU!

Unless you have a problem with stairs or struggle to handle heat (there is no air con, but there are plenty of fans), I can't see anyone finding fault with the space.<br/>Most importantly though, Xavi and Laura are incredibly kind and helpful. You will feel at home almost immediately and they both go above and beyond to make you feel welcome.   Any questions or concerns we had were answered within minutes, regardless of the time. It was an absolutely wonderful experience to get to know them and they elevated the entire trip.

ID: 36957914_610594019623870728, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: It has taken me some time to review my nearly 5 week stay at this AMAZING loft in Barcelona. There are not enough adjectives to completely describe it or the experience I had. But I will try.<br/>¬†<br/>If you search on studios or one bedroom apartments in Barcelona, you will most likely end up with over 300 results. After scrolling through them for hours and hours you will pretty much come to the same conclusion I did PRIOR to booking my Airbnb‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚ÄùThey all look alike‚Äù. Then as I was just about to give up I stumbled across this amazing loft. Now keep in mind, I had not actually stayed there yet, but the listing itself spoke to me. I loved the area. I did not want to stay in the tourist areas. I wanted to immerse myself in Barcelona because I am moving there.<br/>¬†<br/>Ok, enough about me.<br/>¬†<br/>The loft:<br/>Stylish is an understatement. This loft is so cozy, well appointed, and a perfect place to call home while in Barcelona. It has a very, very comfortable and good sized bed. Quality linens, nice pillows. There is even hidden storage under the bed. Perfect for suitcases.¬† <br/>¬†<br/>The kitchen is beyond what you would expect. I am a chef and I had no trouble preparing meals. The refrigerator was so big. ¬†There is an easy to use washing machine, and combination microwave/normal oven. To put it briefly, a perfectly appointed and equipped kitchen. <br/>¬†<br/>The bathroom is spacious and modern. Wonderfully large shower, stylish vanity and sink. <br/>¬†<br/>The storage in the loft was massive. For just one person I barely filled half of it. Great TV with all the media options a person could ask for. Amazon Prime, YouTube, Netflix, and so many others. <br/>¬†<br/>The security system is easy to use and gives you a sense ‚Äúof security‚Äù, even though the building always felt safe. This is a very quiet loft as well. Even if I left a window open at night, the only thing that ever woke me up as the birds. The loft faces into a courtyard area with numerous buildings and many apartments. I rarely heard anyone the entire 5 weeks.<br/>¬†<br/>The area:<br/>I totally loved the cultural diversity of the area. It is filled with so much life. Everyone was so friendly and I enjoyed just walking the neighborhood. So many food options. You are literally 5 minutes from anything you need, including two great gyms, a solarium, markets, pharmacies, and restaurants. The best burger in Barcelona (my opinion) is Fat Schmucks just around the corner. The Sant Antoni market is far better and far less touristy than La Boqueria. However, if you are so inclined to visit La Boqueria on occasion, It‚Äôs only a 5 ‚Äì 8 minute walk. Las Rambla and Place de Catauunya were an easy 10 minute walk as well.<br/>¬†<br/>Most importantly, I ¬†always felt safe in the neighborhood. <br/>¬†<br/>The Host:<br/>Three letters‚Ä¶ OMG!!! Beatriz is AMAZING!!! So friendly, so helpful, available 24/7 it seemed like, to answer any questions I might have had about restaurants, transportation, shopping, and whatever. Even prior to my arrival she was so helpful. Like having my own private concierge. If I needed anything for the loft, she would have it shipped via Amazon practically the next day. I truly got the sense that she genuinely cared about me and my experience. We never had the opportunity to meet face to face during my stay because the had just given birth to twin daughters, but I hope to do so in the future during my next stay.<br/>¬†<br/>Bottom Line:<br/>You can look all you want, but you will not find a more gracious host, a more stylish loft, in such a centrally located area of Barcelona. Just do me a favor, don‚Äôt book up all the nights because I will return and when I do, this is my home in Barcelona.

ID: 37139019_434580188904595729, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: All in all it was a great time in the Barcelona. We booked 2 month. We had big problems with the arrival date. The arrival date has been postponed and luis couldn‚Äôt give us another apartment for the postponed days. Even though it wasn't our fault. Luis had problems with the previous tenant. The trip was completely planed with stops in france and we had to plan the trip again because all was postponed. Because of this our trip with the arrival was 500 ‚Ç¨ more expensive than planed. Luis promised us 2 nights free of charge but but unfortunately it didn't happen until now. Unfortunately the apartment was very dirty. Until the apartment was clean enough to live there were 2 weeks over. We found condoms and there was broken glas in the bedroom. Very dangerous for our baby!!! The kettle and the toaster were broken. We told luis but we didn‚Äôt get a exchange all the time. We had some terrible nights because of other AirBnb tenants who wanted to celebrate all the time and our baby and us couldn‚Äôt sleep. The location of the apartment was very good and central. Afterwards we would say it was not suitable for a family like us. But we made the best of it.

ID: 3764291_53723377, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: We booked the apartment shortly before going, and everything was confirmed very quickly - communication with the owner was very good. They helped with parking information as well. When we arrived (a lot later than first expected), we found an abundance of information on the dining room table. This included information about the apartment (codes and rules), about the local area, restaurant recommendations on a map of the city, an offer through an agreement with a caf√© down the street (‚Ç¨5 for a very simple breakfast - not to our liking unfortunately, but nice nonetheless), WiFi networks and passwords, and maps of the city.
<br/>They had even set up a baby crib for our infant daughter, though this was not requested from our end, and neither was it necessary - this was still very impressive and welcoming.
<br/>
<br/>Because we arrived at a late hour, our contact had left and decided on a time for us to meet the day after - she showed up 20 minutes earlier, as I was on my way out to pick up water, as my wife was getting dressed. She entered the apartment, and it was very uncomfortable for my wife and I, and my wife felt rushed to get dressed to talk. She walked us through the map (very quickly in decent English), and gave us lots of information and adviceyou about the city, including common attractions, how to get there, and suggestions as to what metro card to get - all this was greatly appreciated. 
<br/>The day we were leaving, the same woman came, again earlier than agreed on, and something about the situation made it very hard not to feel rushed and uncomfortable. 
<br/>
<br/>The apartment is very charming, especially when waking up in the morning and peering out through the window from the bed. We were very happy with our stay, and can easily recommend this apartment to anyone going to Barcelona. Had it not been for the feeling we were left with from our contact there, this would have been an easy 5-star rating

ID: 38084157_1125199171873096174, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: This listing, and the price, make it seem as though there will be a private terrace with pool. But the room is on the third floor, like center stage with all the other rooms and all the neighbors looking down onto it. You are in full view of everyone. It is the opposite of private, made me feel very watched & anxious trying to read & work out there. Couldn't even try to relax out there. Clothing-mandatory pool is like a small wading pool, and should only be advertised during warmer months. It is not heated, was unusable while I was there. The terrace lights would not turn off at night and were extremely bright and it took an hour for various technicians to figure it out. There is no living room area or sofa in the whole suite. Only television is in front of the bed. You can hear the neighbors, loudly, from the entry room of the suite. Absolutely not soundproof, & WAY WAY not worth what they charge for it. I feel I am owed a partial refund. Breakfast subpar. Great staff though.

The bed is very comfortable (electric blanket good for warming it up and duvet for keeping you warm). The kitchen and bathroom were functional. The kitchen is small but not too small; the bathroom can be a bit cramped, but it is not a struggle. It is a steep climb up winding stairs, so be prepared. Cristina and Montes (mother and friend), who were there to greet me, are a delight. Great communication from the hosts before my arrival, just in case I had any concerns or questions.

ID: 39353324_635350739809215001, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Our family loved staying with Xavi and Luna! They were wonderful hosts and we loved the apartment for the spacious layout and lots of choices for beds for the 5 people in our family. The entry code to the apartment was easy and it was the same for the rooftop terrace which was great for our jet-lagged bodies. Speaking of the terrace, it was such a wonderful place to hang out in the morning before heading off to enjoy the city and in the afternoon we got home and then in the evening as the sun set. It was also wonderful to be so close to the park and the gothic quarter and less than 20 minutes from the beach. My son loved it so much that he is ready to move to Barcelona!<br/>Gracias Xavi and Luna por una visita fabulosa!

ID: 39404484_1024570062070141179, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Apartamentos excepcionales, bien ubicados y con excelentes recepcionistas. La estancia en el lugar fue tranquila y acogedora, y con buenas vistas de la ciudad.<br/>El metro est√° al lado, y es muy f√°cil llegar a todos los sitios y recorrer Barcelona. Los recepcionistas est√°n siempre atentos y ayudan en todo lo que se necesite. Te gu√≠an y aconsejan muy bien, especialmente para hacer recorridos tur√≠sticos y llegar a los sitios.<br/>Todos los recepcionistas eran muy buenos, pero nos gustar√≠a hacer una menci√≥n especial para Xavi, siempre sonriente y fue nuestro gu√≠a personal (inmejorable).<br/>Ha sido un placer disfrutar nuestras peque√±as vacaciones all√≠, y sin duda alguna volveremos.

The hosts are extremely nice and reply to all our questions, I recommend the place to anyone. The building is old, so expect hearing quite a bit of noise from the neighbors and the stairway, but that wasn't an issue for us.
ID: 3955338_1131791565363768346, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The location is excellent. It is only 2 metro stops to the Sagrada familia and so easy to get around city from apartment.

Great place to explore Barcelona from.

ID: 39940188_591865386715247462, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Martin and Casa Valeta were perfect for a weekend in Barcelona! Beautiful apartment with everything you need, excellent location, and really quiet despite the entrance being on a main road. It is close enough to walk to the centre and main tourist areas while benefitting from the more village like feel of Gracia. Martin was really helpful and communicative, gave us plenty of suggestions and always answered our questions very promptly! He was also very flexible with check in even though we arrived after midnight, which was greatly appreciated. Could not recommend enough!
ID: 39940188_617846005763379216, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: We spent a lot of time trying to find the perfect balance of location, quality of accommodations and price for our weekend in Barcelona, and we got it all right with Casa Valeta. Adding our praise to all the other reviews, Martin and his apartment are what make Airbnb such a great travel partner. Perhaps the one pleasant surprise was how lovely it was to have the quiet balcony as a respite from the hustle of the city. The view is fine, but it's just a great change of pace for morning coffee or evening wine. We would book this again in a second.

The location was excellent for sightseeing and restaurants/bars, but the area didn't feel busy or rowdy. Julie was great with communication and personally welcomed us from the airport (for a small and reasonable pick-up fee).  The bathroom was small but it was fine for small sized guests.  Perhaps some little things such as tea bags and coffee would have made things more convenient, but there are plenty of grocery stores nearby. Thanks Julie!

My fault.<br/>The shower is extremely small and hot water lasts about 4 minutes. The bathroom is moist, water from the shower covers the bathroom floor and the drawers below the sink, should be addressed by the owner.

You will hear them EVERY night when trying to go to bed. They sound like they‚Äôll fall on you.<br/>- bathroom plumbing not well constructed. Toilet and shower drains clog constantly<br/>- lacks basic amenities such as garbage bags, shampoo, or even cooking oil. <br/>- apartment had strange smell that is really hard to purge, even after opening windows<br/>I wouldn‚Äôt come back to stay here, but it‚Äôs not a bad place overall.

The appartment has all amnities you need and has a very beautiful dining space which is perfectly enjoyable in the sun. We would 100% come back when visiting barcelona. 15 min walk from plaza Catalunya, 10 min to Sagrada, 25 min walk to gothic area, so perfectly doable and if need be you get a taxi for 8 euro towards the shore area. So overall we would always come back to the appartment when visiting BCL.

Dennoch ist alles n√∂tige vorhanden um gem√ºtlich miteinander zu kochen. Es hat an nichts gefehlt, au√üer mehr Zeit.
ID: 43423133_664240709457705369, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The Airbnb was nice! Really enjoyed my stay. Thought the interior room with no window would be a problem, but it wasn‚Äôt. I enjoyed being in there. The fan kept it from getting super hot in the room, especially if you kept the lights low. And it felt private, which I enjoy.<br/>The labeling of different spots for your room was a nice touch. Ex. Place for your towel and things in the bathroom, and a labeled shelf in the refrigerator. Nice!<br/>The location was fabulous. Within close walking distance to so many attractions.<br/>I‚Äôd def stay again! The check-in host was super kind and helpful! I appreciate it!<br/>I also barely saw other guests. Didn‚Äôt feel like I had to fight for space or anything.<br/>They also provided detergent for washing clothes. Really nice, y‚Äôall! Thank you!

ID: 4344370_1125242419558914562, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: This place is at the top of our Airbnb experiences. It is a spacious one level facility which is well equipped and in a great location. It was perfect for my wife and I for the three days we spent in Barcelona. If we ever go back to Barcelona, we would absolutely return. The bay window sitting area was my favorite place to sit and sip a glass of wine while observing the street activities below. Everything is in walking distance and easy to get around. The facility is on the fifth floor accessible by a small very slow elevator. Fortunately, we were OK with using the stairs to come and go. However, getting your luggage up to the facility will take a couple of runs in the elevator.
ID: 4344370_467859541949873637, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The apartment is superb and in a perfect location. From the welcome on arrival through to departure the communication was excellent. If you are looking for beautiful accommodation, with excellent facilities and access to a rooftop terrace I can definitely recommend. Thanks for a great stay---I will definitely be back.

ID: 439057_486970956, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The location was perfect.  Walked to Sagrada Familia (don't forget to buy tix online in advance - a must), Casa Batllo and even the Picasso Museum.   Agree with all the recent reviews that the neighborhood is full of life, especially on the weekend, and the windows drowned it out nicely.  There are 4 room air conditioners although only run 2 at most in order to not overload the circuits - that was easy.  The pull out bed in the pics is now on a frame so that was an unexpected bonus for us.  Javier was great with communication.  Definitely recommend.  Thanks Javier!<br/>Kevin

The space was incredible, holding the charm of the tastefully updated historic building. Our balcony was a great place to get a gauge on the goings on, as well as drying our beach gear. The breakfast had a bit for everyone and the free coffee was a lifesaver after our days out exploring the city. The ac in the room was also a nice treat after a day out in the humid heat of the city. 10/10 would recommend!

ID: 44015385_723037463618511906, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The apartment is exactly as it seems and is a great value where it is located. It was clean, large, and well furnished and supplied. The check in was not an issue as described in some of the other reviews. As long as you have the app and put in the effort to complete the information, you can go straight to the apartment with the app and things worked smoothly. Our only issue was there were some times where the app would be slow to load or log out so we had to wait to open the room. But we had no other issues that led us to contact the company. You can tell it is a company run AirBNB so there aren't a lot of personalized touches if that is important to you, but it does mean you know what to expect. Would definitely stay again if in the area.

ID: 45153542_880308673513816558, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: I really recommend Anna Maria's apartment, I had a great stay with no complaints.<br/>I stayed at the apartment for 4 weeks. I used it as a base camp to search for a long term apartment because I am relocating to Barcelona for work. I needed somewhere central and it was ideal.<br/>The apartment was well stocked with everything I needed. All the kitchen supplies I needed were there. There were some basic supplies when I arrived on my first day like some tea / coffee which I was grateful for.<br/>It is in a very central location. There are some very large supermarkets (eg Carrefour) only 7 mins walk away. It is 10 mins walk from Placa de Catalonia a huge shopping area.<br/>The apartment is on the 4th floor well away from the street and is quiet most of the time. The neighbourhood can be a bit loud on weekends but the apartment is far away from it.<br/>Anna Marias communication was very good. I had an issue with the sofa (it got broken) and Anna Maria resolved it quickly and professionally.

ID: 4542712_681590223641542735, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: From the moment we checked in the disaster started.<br/> The apartment was dirty, bed sheets dirty, floors dirty, windows dirty, washer and dishwasher moldy.<br/>There were 2 cameras in the apartment and a device where you could be listened in on in one of the bedrooms. We immediately had it removed, and advised them of the illegality.  <br/>No constant hot water for a month, no television for a month, had to purchase our own pots and pans because the ones there were burnt and unusable. <br/>Not as depicted in the photographs which were staged. The warm inviting look was anything but what was portrayed. <br/>The hosts did not value our time and we had at least 10 times where we needed to be at the apartment for people to try and correct or fix problems.  <br/>Air conditioners that squealed, water leaks from the apartment above, power outages, and Poorly informed representatives for the owner. Had to do our own research to tell them how to fix a Bosch water heater, and after a month and 4 previous visits it was fixed.<br/>We use Airbnb a lot, and this is the first time we have ever had an issue, but there were so many issues, we are surprised that Airbnb allows this apartment to be on their site.<br/>Airbnb‚Äôs support groups were amazing with their responsiveness, and their follow through.<br/>One suggestion, always communicate in writing on the Airbnb site for good or bad. With the host or Airbnb.

The apartment was beautifully renovated and had all the amenities you would need (especially air conditioning!). Host was very responsive. The only heads-up I would give is that the stairs getting to the 1st floor apartment are narrow and a little steep, so older adults may have some challenges.  We had a wonderful time and would definitely stay again.

ID: 47948253_657750575094178162, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Nice unit in a good neighborhood. Plenty of room for us two adults and three kids. Beds weren‚Äôt super comfortable but were passable. Unit definitely shows it‚Äôs age and could use some maintenance. Nothing extreme, and the place was comfortable. Close to subway and other sites. <br/>One concerning issue is that there is no way to lock the entry door from the inside. Nothing happened during our stay, but you are at the will of the security of the digital code entered outside of the unit. There are no keys. <br/>Otherwise pretty good place in a great town.

ID: 48292590_1224579350700249265, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: 4 nights in Barcelona and we swapped from a place out of town to Hotel Brummell. What a find. Everything as described, really friendly and very helpful and communicative. Have a list of recommended places to visit/eat in the elevator - we used it twice and both restaurants were fantastic. Really handily placed for the cable cars to Montjuic and the beach. Pool area is quiet and catches the sun, peaceful area.
ID: 48323857_1022374551365905856, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Had a excellent stay in Barcelona. Everything was great and as described. We were traveling with a 1 yr old baby, and they had a high chair, pack and play and even toys for us. Location was great as we walked to a lot of the different areas and great restaurants. Would stay again for sure!
ID: 48348783_937489509220091721, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Excellent location, close to Pl Catalunya to take the metro anywhere and plenty of things to see and do in the neighborhood. The sink was leaking water all over the floor when I tried to use it and after contacting Sonder someone was there and had it fixed within an hour. Would definitely stay here again.

ID: 487233_6271125, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Our stay in Anna's apartment was great. we loved this apartment!! it is probably the best place we stayed with airbnb. the apartment is full equipment, fantastic decorate with taste and color. Big and lovely kitchen. it has a really big roof terrace with bbQ, outdoor shower and a wide view over the city Barcelona. the presence of all the plants and flowers makes the terrace one to remember. the apartments location is peace and quiet, although nearby a metro station (green line) so you have a direct en fast access to all the known places. its a good place to escape from busy and noisy tourists. if underground  metro is not your thing, you can discover the city by Anna's bikes, like we did. it's a lot of fun! our specials thanks go to Anna for all info about the neighborhood, places to eat &drink & places to see in the city. And for loading up the fridge with delicious products to have breakfast. we definitely recommend this place, it's fantastic!! Anna, thanks for all help & your good care. Next time in Barcelona we wish to come back. Leen&kevin
ID: 48818432_992604265191939178, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: This is one of the finest properties I‚Äôve stayed in. I‚Äôve worked in Travel Industry for years and this exceeded my expectation.   If your an art lover the interior has many great pieces.  Great location, responsive host, beautiful apartment with and incredible rooftop patio.  Everything was better than the photos showed.  Carles is an excellent host and his staff greeted us on arrival to drop our bags before unit was ready. Walking distance to everything. Market directly across the street with food and wine.  The building itself was spectacular.  This rooftop apartment wins all the awards.  We will certainly be back
ID: 49032197_989032809512977125, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Awesome spacious and clean apartment with very nice interiors. Lots of restaurants and shops close to it. Subway train station is super close. <br/>The only downside is that there‚Äôs a kid upstairs that constantly runs around in the afternoon but not so much during the evening and at night time. <br/>Bed and sheets were super nice and comfortable.

ID: 4911075_478756137891196205, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The location is great for a stay in Barcelona.  Walking distance to most sites in the Gothic Quarter and El Born. We took Aerobus from the airport.  Stop is two blocks from apartment at the Placa Catalunya. Metro stop at also located at the same location. Also taxi cabs and tour bus stops at Placa Catalunya. Lots of restuarants and shopping close by.  El Cortes Ingles, a large department/grocery store is a couple blocks away. Apartment was very clean and we really enjoyed having the washer/dryer and kitchen.  Apartment is as shown in the pictures provided on AirBnB site, no surprises.  Onsite doorman during the day when the building door is open. Elevator works well to take you to the fifth floor. Both checking in and out were fast, easy and simple.  We enjoyed Barcelona and this definately enhanced our experience.

ID: 4911075_815769511600274866, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Location is the biggest highlight of the apartment- very conveniently located half a block from the Plaza Catalunya.  Apartment is on 6th floor but has an elevator.  It was very convenient- has the basics for cooking and even some basic ingredients gradients (salt, pepper, oil, etc.), the heat worked fine (it was January), had good warm water for the shower.   The two twin beds are awkward for couples.  We knew about it because of reviews, nevertheless it was a downside.  The couch was also uncomfortable.  The apartment felt a little tired and could use some little tlc with organizing cupboards, defrosting freezer, and general freshening up.  It was clean.  Worked good for us.
ID: 4911075_939709602733633781, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The Airbnb was very well located. Close to everything. The apartment is as listed. The host (David) was very responsive.

ID: 49610627_903448284984103349, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Overall we enjoyed our stay here and would recommend this place. <br/>It has the L2 metro just outside the entrance and the L4 is a 5 minute walk.  Makes it easy to get around.  The con to this is if you are a light sleeper you may hear the very low rumble as the L2 goes by.  Can only hear in bedrooms. <br/>The bad experience we had here was ants and lots of them. Took a couple weeks to get spray delivered. We had them on the counters, kitchen floor, dining area, and bathroom. Even with spraying, we still had ants coming around within a few days. The worst part was sitting at the eating table working and having ants crawling on my legs.  I went out of my way for the next group of people coming in and bought spray and used the whole can so they could have a better experience. <br/>Back to the good. Kitchen is well stocked for cooking. Furniture comfy. Patio is nice. Just be aware there is a school and you will hear kids playing.  Laundry was good. <br/>Some major attractions are within 20 min walk.
ID: 4973692_255384642, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Juan was an excellent host. Left us a map to places we wanted to see at checkin and even stopped by with an extension cord. The place is close to metro and allowed us to see the entire city and places like Monserratt easily. Would definitely stay there again.
ID: 49749120_1023127323399589124, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The appartment boasts an excellent location and the room, along with the shared bathrooms, were maintained in immaculate condition. Always had soap in every rooms, T.P. available etc... The addition of coffee and bread in the morning was a delightful touch. One point to note for future guests staying in this particular room is its proximity to the apartment's main entrance. This may result in some noise during the night as other guests come and go, which is something to be mindful of if you're a light sleeper (me üò≠)

Only comment, several restaurants indicated on the website they were open and when you got there they were closed.

ID: 50201349_534638270448715010, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The location of the apartment is excellent! The living area is a little dark due to limited windows, but if you are in this location you probably won't spend much time there. The apartment is small but comfortable. We traveled as a couple with a toddler and there was plenty of space for us. The apartment had everything we needed. It is very close to grocery stores, cafes, bars, the metro, and is next to Lennon Plaza. We found the apartment to be quiet and comfortable.

ID: 50775189_699053119959548640, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: This apartment is right in the heart of the El Gotico district, close to almost everything you'd want to do in Barcelona, and right on a Metro line if you need to venture further afield.  It is clean, with great views from two of the four bedrooms and could easily handle up to four couples.  The public space is a little small, but you'll want to be out on the town!

ID: 5124937_312749305, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: His place has a fantastic view of the Sagrada Familia.  It's a large unit with ample space.  I would highly recommend reviewing the house rules so you are familiar with any additional fees (such as fees for taxes that are separate, fees for checking in late, etc).  We had a great time in Barcelona at this place it is close to public transportation as well as bike rental spots. 
ID: 5124937_52209860, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The location of the apartment is ideal if not a little noisy at night. It was very clean and well equipped, however I would recommend taking some slippers as all floors are tiled and as such a little chilly under foot at this time of year.<br/>There are no English channels on the television which would of been nice after a long day of sight seeing. Perhaps additional arm chairs would be good as there is only one three seater sofa. Which would not sit five if the apartment was full-time and this wasn't very comfortable.<br/>On the whole,a great location, great views, close to the metro.<br/>Would recommend for a weekend break.<br/>

It is also very close to a metro station, a supermarket and buses.<br/>Fiona was an excellent host, was very responsive and truly wanted my stay to be a great one, which it was. I recommend this property and Fiona & Phil definitely deserve their being listed as 'Super Hosts'.

ID: 51832395_825272765984124720, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Great stay at the apartment.  The place was well kitted out with everything you'd need for a comfortable stay.  Plenty of room for a family of 4 plus quiet place to be ensuring a good night's sleep.  Well located so you can walk to most attractions.  Stefan was very helpful and gave some great restaurant recommendations.  The only minor issue we had was the lights in one room wouldn't turn off when we first got there - Stefan did sort that out as soon as he could the next day and was always on hand to help if we needed it. Highly recommend
ID: 5184160_124653300, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Sara's place is awesome. It's near to the beach only 5-10 min away from the beach. It is also 15mins walking distance away from placa de catalunya, which is the center of Barcelona. In front of the place there are a lot of good restaurants. Eventhough she wasnt there during my stay, her sister welcomed me. So for the whole time I was alone in the place. Her aparment was very clean. I would chose this apartment again if I go again to Barcelona again. Thank you Sara 
ID: 5184160_90441859, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Sara was very nice, she was always there when I needed her but very discreet at the same time.
<br/>The flat is very close from the Barceloneta beach and there's everything you need around. (Grocery stores, bars, restaurants...)
<br/>I would definitely recommend it!
<br/>
<br/>Thank you for everything Sara!

ID: 52162671_964385167447915905, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: This hotel is in a beautiful old building in the heart of a gorgeous part of Barcelona, right in the center of most tourist destinations.   And they have a beautiful garden deck and common lounge area for those times you just want to relax.  <br/>The rooms are nicely decorated, and the staff is very friendly and helpful.   They can even get you a gluten-free treat instead of the croissants they provide in the morning.  <br/>I would definitely stay here again.
ID: 52164638_545494094039815317, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The flat was cozy and clean. Location is perfect! Close to grocery stores and the center. <br/>In the flat we found a document with recommendations of restaurants and grocery stores and It was very helpful.<br/>In the apartment we found shower supplies and nice Cava as a welcome gift from the owner. <br/>Internet speed is amazing, you will be able to stream, videoconference and upload files at the same time!<br/>However, there were couple moments that made our staying a little bit difficult such as:<br/>It was cold in the apartment since heater didn‚Äôt work much.<br/>You have to be mindful of electricity consumption, whenever there was high electricity usage it would stop and would have to be restarted (this could take up to 30m)<br/>During check-in we had to wait for 1h 30m for the girl to let us in. We asked for early checkin the day before but we got an answer until we arrived at the airport, with airport delays we couldn‚Äôt arrive exactly at the time we mentioned the day before leading to this. <br/>Communication with the owner was polite and helpful but slow. We had to wait a while for each answer.<br/>Pay attention, there is a number for urgent questions in the flat document it is wrong number

ID: 5322583_162255793, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: A blessing by the beach. This apartment is amazing. All the amenities you would need and literally only a block from the beach. If you happen to have forgotten something, there are many stores and a mall across the street. I would recommend traveling about a mile down the road where the food is less touristy and more authentic. The host Rosa, is second to none. She made everything extra easy and was super helpful. I look forward to my next visit to Barcelona

The cruise ship would not let us stay on the ship until check in but Carla kept our bags for us until we could get into the apartment. The apartment was spectacular! Large rooms, a fully outfitted kitchen, a refreshment center in the basement and a spectacular rooftop lounging area. There are restaurants really close by and the staff were so helpful in accommodating our American meal times. (Dinner is after 8pm.) I highly recommend staying here as they make vacationing so easy.

Seriously stop reading other reviews and book this place. I scoured Airbnb for a private terrace and this is exceptional.

Going southeast takes you toward the beach, going northwest takes you up toward stunning parks which overlook the city. For a few days of personal time / adaptation before a week of work in BCN, it was absolutely ideal. <br/>The hotel staff and concierge were not just helpful, but personable and friendly. I enjoyed chatting with them individually and appreciated the info they shared about the experience of living in BCN. Their recommendations were spot on.<br/>On arrival, communication was very easy and staff were flexible about letting me check in as soon as my room as ready, as well as stowing luggage / allowing access to coworking space for a few hours so I could keep up with a few work tasks until my other lodging became available.<br/>Could easily spend several more days here - nearby so many parks and cafes. Hope to again sometime!

ID: 5524663_327753190, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Jerry‚Äôs place was wonderful. The elevator was finicky, so we had to go one floor higher and walk down. But it wasn‚Äôt a problem. He is a smoker, so there‚Äôs a lingering cigarette smell in the place, but it was not too intense and he was very clear and upfront about it. He was super helpful about laundry, clean, switching out linens, and so forth. One thing I‚Äôd change is it would be nice to have a curtain on the guest side of the door. The glass is blurred, but it would lend more privacy. Otherwise, it suited us very well.

The beach is easily reachable via that station. It's also centrally located and near several supermarkets. I highly recommend this place for your time in Barcelona!

ID: 563971_363268995, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The location was great, with a fun gin & tonic bar on one corner and a breakfast cafe on another corner. <br/>We felt safe in this neighborhood and enjoyed being close enough to touristy stuff, but far enough away to feel as though we were living like the locals.<br/>Be advised that the apartment faces the street and there is some occasional street noise, but our iPad‚Äôs white noise app was sufficient to mask that (the bedroom is in the interior of the unit.)

ID: 563971_954215899575200572, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Arama was a great host, very proactive to ensure that the stay was as convenient and enjoyable as possible. The location of the apartment in El Poble Sec is very close to transport routes and there are multiple breakfast, evening meal and bar options nearby, while also in a quiet corner of the neighbourhood. A highly recommended location.

ID: 564809_338640972, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: I very much enjoyed my stay with N√©stor! He mostly only speaks Spanish but that just adds to the experience (and gave me a chance to practice!). Despite the language barrier, I was able to communicate with him without any issues. The location is in the Gr√†cia where you‚Äôll find more locals and less tourists - a positive for me. That said, the more popular/touristy areas are really close by and walkable (maybe 20-30 min max to La Boqueria/Gothic Quarter). If you don‚Äôt want to walk, public transportation is pretty accessible, but taking a stroll through Barcelona was quite pleasing and fantastic. Lots of great bars/restaurants/shopping close by the apartment. There was some street noise at night but it wasn‚Äôt bad by any means. The room otherwise was spacious and the entire apartment clean. I would recommend N√©stor‚Äôs place for a great time in Barcelona!

The second bedroom is really only suitable for one adult or kids. I also find it strange that toiletries like shampoo are provided but soap to wash hands isn't. All in all it was a good stay though and there is no better location in Barcelona

ID: 5818871_52231220, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Juan Carlos was a great host, he met me earlier on Friday than originally stated and showed us around his beautiful apartment. 
<br/>
<br/>We loved the location, very central and easy to navigate from. On the first day we were lucky to have great weather and sat and enjoyed lunch purchased from the deli downstairs and next to the Carrefour Express.
<br/>
<br/>There were 4 of us staying and the apartment had plenty of room. 
<br/>
<br/>Juan Carlos left numerous guidebooks and tips for restaurants. One we used and we would pass on is Tapas at Vinitus. Unbelievably good food and great value.
<br/>
<br/>We would definitely recommend this apartment for a great stay in Barcelona.

It is located 70 meters from the Sagrada Familia, and is close to many of Barcelonas‚Äô amazing attractions. Taxis flow freely by on the street below. What is not to like?
ID: 5867314_275500599, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: We stayed in Romina's apartment for 4 days and had a great time. She was very quick to respond on whatsapp to any questions we had. The apartment is as it looks in the pictures. It's very close to<br/> Sagrada Familia. There are supermarkets and metro stations nearby too.
ID: 588268_9008771, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: We stayed at this apartment for a week and found the experience good, but not excellent. Primarily this was due to construction work every day (including Saturday and Sunday) that began around 8:30am and continued sporadically throughout the day. The sounds or drills and saws came from multiple locations, so there may in fact have been multiple projects taking place simultaneously.
<br/>
<br/>This apartment had more things in it than most AirBnB places where we have stayed, which was both good and bad. We appreciated plenty of pillows, blankets, pots, pans, and plates, but there was also a significant amount of food left in the refrigerator and cupboards, including plenty of empty containers ready for recycling. The kitchen and TV areas look out to the interior of this residential block, and it's great to see how the residents of the area use their balconies! Inside, the apartment's artwork/advertisements for a website, waauuu.com, are imposing.
<br/>
<br/>Having stayed in other places in the older La Ribera and El Raval districts, we found the large blocks of this area less convenient for walking, although the nearby Sagrada Familia metro stop makes subway travel easy. The cost was high compared to other apartments in Barcelona, but for visitors prizing the proximity of La Sagrada Familia, it's perfect.

They also gave us a bottle of cava when we arrived. Highly recommend!

ID: 5924404_107703401, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Lovely stay in the apartment and also in Barcrlona! Montse made sure my family and I were taken care of from the time of booking to checking out. She was very courteous and she ensured I was aware of different attractions and "must-see" in the city. As a tourist hearing from the local is definitely a great help! As for the apartment it was a lovely place with its locations and amenities it provided. It has a heat/cool AC unit that ran through every rooms. The wifi was the best we had used. At times I can smell smokes but I believed it was from the neighbor. The 2 bathrooms was a bonus for a family of 6 so we didn't have to wait in line for shower. Overall it was a very great experience!!

Her apartment is central and off a big road, less than five minutes walk to the metro. Ten minutes walk from Sagrada. 30 minutes taxi ride from the airport (there is a metro/bus option which we didn‚Äôt taake). <br/>We prebooked Barcelona Modernista card which includes 10 free attractions (casa battilo, palau de musica, etc). The bus stop for the attractions is right in front of her building. The room in the apartment faced a small street which is very quiet during the day and at night. There were comments about the washroom from other reviewers but we found it adequate. We will come back and stay with Lili again.

ID: 644618512610477011_664970319680449819, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: During our entire stay at Sweet Inn. The elevator did not work, and we were placed on the sixth floor. This is super inconvenient because my mother has knee problems and she has had surgery and other treatments to get better. The worst part is that they knew this elevator was not working even before they "confirmed" our stay. They were in contact with my as you can see in the conversation asking me about proof of identity, and at this point they could have let me know of this inconvenience and I would have booked another place to stay. This is unnacceptable and we had to help my mom go up the stairs every time we entered and left the building.

ID: 6511821_487784613, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Outstanding place in a great location in Barcelona! The place was quiet and clean. Barcelona is very hot during the summer, so the heat was inevitable, but Isabelle‚Äôs Place wasn‚Äôt that hot in our opinion.

Safe neighborhood with easy access to metro and restaurants.  All items needed were provided onsite.  Bathrooms were a little tight, but it‚Äôs Spain so that‚Äôs not uncommon but something to note.  <br/>Overall great experience and thank you Matthias for a lovely home and exceptional service!  Hope to see you next time we are in Barcelona.

ID: 656990_1160769602757993500, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: This is a quiet residential street and area. Very very close to several metro stops and (if you try to map route) the bus (which will take you to many Central locales).  I was traveling solo, so everything worked out very well. I took the subway many times. I visited many locations in five days, and enjoyed. Diana's place was a good spot for me. The shower is very strong, the water temperature good. There is kitchen facility, which I really did not use. This is walking distance from a Grazia district, which is full of winding streets and little shops and caf√©.  Thank you for the use of the apartment.
ID: 6585803_517960760465322329, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: My family and I had a really great time in this apartment.  The place is super clean and very well equipped.  It is kid friendly and very well maintained.  Location is great and in a good neighborhood.  It is near bus and metro to get around and parks if you have kids.  One of my favorites was an organic supermarket around the corner.<br/>For our family, there was only one inconvenience which is not having access to set the temperature.  Our baby had a cold, so it was a bit more of an issue.  We would still come back for sure.<br/>Highly recommend you stay here.
ID: 6587944_102787870, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Anne est sympathique et l'appartement est spacieux. <br/>il est bien situ√© pour ceux qui veulent visiter. <br/>N√©anmoins il est tr√®s sombre m√™me en pleine journ√©e et soleil. <br/>nous √©tions 3 et les lits ne sont pas top.

ID: 6587944_139661469, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: We booked Anne's place for roughly 1.5 weeks for a family trip to Barcelona. Things went OK, but we have some reservations about this apartment.<br/>The good: <br/> - The location is great and there are plenty of restaurants with excellent food all around it. <br/> - For families, there is a playground right down the street for all age groups.<br/> - It's rather quiet considering its location since it's situated at the back of the building. Nonetheless the neighbors seem to like to party on Friday and sometimes Saturday, too...<br/> - The apartment was clean.<br/> - Anne provided a high chair and a cot for our daughter.<br/> - The kitchen is adequate to cook food from the nice markets.<br/>The bad:<br/> - The dishwasher was broken when we arrived and covered in mold; it had clearly not been used in a while. Anne fixed it, but it took almost a week. That the dishwasher was broken should have been obvious to anyone looking at the place...<br/> - The washing machine smelled of mold, too. We cleaned it with some bleach, so that's mostly fixed now.<br/> - The apartment is called "bright and comfy", but it really isn't bright. Especially not with the brown/gray walls; the rooms are rather dark. Maybe for Barcelona standards it's bright? Certainly not for ours. At least there is a wall of windows facing the courtyard.<br/> - The bedrooms have windows facing some shafts that let in some light, but unfortunately also some pretty bad odors. There is no fresh air in the bedrooms other than opening the windows, and when a sewage smell comes in... yuck. The complaints of another reviewer are not fixed. Not sure if that's even fixable...<br/> - There are lots of small things broken; a dresser drawer came apart, the blinds are mostly broken. If there had been a screw driver in the apartment I would have fixed these things, but there aren't any tools.<br/> - We could continue with the small things; basically there are just lots of small annoyances that maybe aren't a big deal if you stay a few nights. For a longer stay I can just say that I've been in more convenient places, including in Barcelona.<br/>We'd recommend the place for people staying for short periods who are going to enjoy the nightlife. If you have kids it probably isn't the right place...
ID: 6587944_52745794, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: there is good and bad for this apartment.
<br/>
<br/>the good is that anne is an excellent email communicator. christian met us a the location and he was great. the apartment is nice and light and the kitchen is well stocked. the building is in a fantastic location. absolutely couldnt be better. the master bedroom and bath are large and nice. anne connected us with a parking lot nearby that landed up costing 10euros a day for long term which is very good.
<br/>
<br/>the bad is that there was a bad sewage smell in the building hallways and much worse downstairs. it permeated the apartment slightly too. this has  been mentioned in another review. when i told anne about it she did send someone over and it seemed to lessen but not totally go away. anne also has made up her own rules regarding check in. she requires you to be there between 17.00 and 20.00 and if you come late you are charged a fine. i find that outrageous as a business person. 
<br/>
<br/>be aware that the second bedroom is small. it is fine but not spacious. the bathroom however has absolutely no where to even put a toothbrush or paste down. there are no shelves to store your toiletries at all. there were no trash cans in either bathroom. i let anne  know about that and she said that she would look into it.
<br/>the dishwasher did not seem to be working although it could be operator error---i dont think so.

ID: 666515186487242337_886092116153377414, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: We were very well taken care of. Josephina is an exceptional host and we very much appreciated her speaking excellent English to us. The apartment is spotless, lots of extras like detergents, dish washing liquid. The coffee pods and tea were invaluable after a long flight, so making these moments to refresh a treat. We were a party of four who enjoyed the spacious sitting and dining areas for breakfast and conversation late in the evening after long days exploring this wonderful city. It's an older apartment that's been very well appointed and modernized, yet still has it's true Barcelona character intact. Kudos to the owners for helping maintain these buildings which no doubt need much maintenance.<br/>Arc de Triomf is a close an easily accessible station for your trips around the city if going beyond the nearby Eixample/Gothic section of town. <br/>We will of course recommend to our friends with 100% confidence.
ID: 667177_87813235, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: I am attempting to leave a balanced review, which represents our true experience:
<br/>Teresa is very pleasant, responsive and helpful, a great host.
<br/>Her home has many great features, the pictures and description are pretty actuate.
<br/>As others have said, it is near the metro, bus lines, shopping center and about 1 mile from a beach.  However, it is also next to an auto body shop which can be pretty loud starting about 8 or 9am.  The neighborhood looks to be in a transitional phase and if currently very industrial, but it is very close to the "locals" restaurants & area (Poble Nou).
<br/>The home has everything you need for a long stay (we stayed 2 weeks), however being from the US we found the beds a bit uncomfortable.  The terrance upstairs is very nice (one of the rooms is up there with no AC), however please know it only accessible using outdoor stairs, meaning everything needs to be carried up and down these stairs.
<br/>All in all if you want to be off the beaten path in a up and coming area and hosted by a wonderful person- this checks all the boxes.

ID: 6722829_278901781, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The place is nice, despite being surrounded by a strange and desolate business park.  You'll be required to use the Sweet Inn App, which I don't like and overall the price is too high for what you get.  It worked for us in a pinch, but I'd suggest you stay in the Gothic area of Barca and avoid the Sweet Inn locations unless you plan to shack up in one spot for a while.

The large eat-in and fully stocked kitchen replete with every utensil and appliance I needed, and a good collection of spices, meant I didn‚Äôt have to buy anything.

The bedrooms are both functional, the kitchen is nicely equipped, the shower is spectacular (rainfall, great water pressure), and the mattresses and pillows are high-quality. It's a perfect space for a few days -- with the one warning that the walls and ceilings are *really* thin and you can hear literally everything going on around you. But that was a very minor concern, as none of the neighbours were particularly loud. We'd be very happy to stay here again.

ID: 7003642_596153138792919775, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: We were very excited to stay here based on the good reviews but the poor communication and cleanliness of the apartment left us very disappointed. Upon checking in, we found garbage left in the sink which we chalked up to being left by the cleaning crew and decided was not a big deal. However, later on in our stay we found ants on various surfaces in the home and they even got in our belongings. There were no instructions listed inside the home. Additionally, we had trouble locating the thermostat on our first night and messaged the hosts for assistance. They were unclear in their description while trying to help us and did not reply back until 12+ hours later - this is unacceptable. They claimed they do not check their messages in the evening and that we should have called them for further assistance. I could not locate the phone number for the hosts anywhere on the app or in the home. I can understand not checking messages in the evening but since we were in the middle of a conversation, the hosts should have been the ones to reach out to me to correct the issue and not leave me hanging overnight. Otherwise, the apartment included the listed amenities and the location was convenient. The neighbors were a little noisy at times as mentioned by previous reviews. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this stay.

Auch bei fragen zu Barcelona wussten sie immer Bescheid und konnten Antwort geben. Check in und Check ihr liegen reibungslos. Auf Wunsch waschen die Gastgeber sogar W√§sche! An den Gastgebern gab es keinen Zweifel. Einziges Manko ist vielleicht das, dass Haus etwas hellh√∂rig ist, was aber in Barcelona wohl normal ist. Was uns aber nicht gro√ü beeintr√§chtigte. Der Strand war Fussl√§ufig erreichbar so wie die "La Rambla". Es liegen 2 Metros in unmittelbarer N√§he so wie ein Aerobus Halt. <br/>Insgesamt ein Super Host und eine gute Lage!

ID: 7562579_726664972803025337, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Excellent stay at Marians place. I have been staying there for a month-long trip with two colleagues.<br/>Inside the apartment<br/>The apartment looks quite structured. It is small in some rooms but it works. It has all necessary things for a long-term stay. Basic cleaning service was included once per week which was great and Marian was really responsive if we had any question.<br/>Work<br/>The Airbnb is perfect to work from. We commuted to an office in Passeig de Gracia or El Poblenou and public transportation got us there quite quickly. For the times we have worked from home, the internet was super stable and fast. The furniture provided in the apartment was also really great to work from home on certain days.<br/>Area of the apartment<br/>The big plus of the apartment is the area where it is located. Some really good restaurants are around in the area (Bar Calders, Takearte, ...). The area is kind of local, so it won't be so touristy which is quite great. If you want to go into the touristy areas, then those will be just a metro-ride away.<br/>We have visited beaches many times during our stay. Castelldefels is only one hour away by a bus ride without changing the line and Barceloneta and other city beaches are reachable via another bus without changing. Super comfortable to go for an evening on the beach after work.<br/>Time of our visit<br/>We have visited during September/October. The weather was quite warm in the beginning with reaching 30 degrees easily but it got colder during our month-long stay. It was honestly the perfect weather to be in Barcelona.<br/>Overall, we have really enjoyed the stay in Marians apartment. Its perfect for remote working/studying for a longer time with a group of people.

Made contact with Federico when we arrived at the airport and he was at the apartment when we arrived.<br/>Perfect location. 10 minutes walk to the beach, with lots of shops near by including a Lidl. The Rambla del Poblenou is only five minutes away and there is an endless selection of bars are restaurants to chose from on a lovely pedestrian street. Additionally there is a metro near by which brings you right to the centre of Barcelona in just a few stops.<br/>As a host Federico was amazing. Was very responsive and willing to help us out in whatever way he could. Excellent host. I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking to say in a more relaxed part of Barcelona.<br/>Thanks Federico!

The apartment is located in a really busy, bougie neighborhood with alot of restaurants and bars. We stood there when a street festival with lots of music took place. We could even watch some performances from the nice little balcony. And when we shut the windows they were sound proof. So even though the streets where busy we had a quiet place. Very recommendable in all senses!

This was no issue for us as we had a Europe-wide SIM at the time, but this wasn't communicated clearly. There is no lockpad/keypad to enter, you need to have a mobile phone with data/wifi.

There were also other Airbnbs in the neighbourhood, which guaranteed a social exchange. The apartment was also very large for the number of rooms. We were looking for a balcony for our accommodation which we had as describedüëå. The owner was also very proactive and even offered to show us 2-3 things himself. It was a very pleasant and friendly atmosphere and if we had a problem we could always approach him. What we found particularly great was that the airbnb was furnished in a modern style and had everything we needed.

But not too bad and clearly communicated by Joaquin. Thank you both for our pleasant stay.

La casa era pulita in generale, peccato per un cuscino che aveva la federa sporca. Due pecche: una √® il bagno, che ha solo una piccola finestrella, l‚Äôaltra √® una delle camere, che si trova vicino all‚Äôentrata e non viene raggiunta dall‚Äôaria condizionata che si trova nel salotto alla fine di un corridoio. Gli host sono stati molto gentili e reattivi nelle risposte, inviando anche una lista di posti consigliati dove bere e mangiare. Check-in molto facile e accesso alla casa molto comodo visto che le porte (quella del condominio e quella dell‚Äôappartamento) si aprono tramite un link che viene fornito prima dell‚Äôarrivo.

The location was good, though a bit of a walk from gothic quarter. Host was communicative, which was appreciated. We were a bit disappointed to find that the unit was lacking in certain amenities such as shampoo, body wash, paper towels in the kitchen. We also tried to use the water boiler but found that it was a bit dirty. I think this Airbnb has a lot of potential but could use a bit more attention in management.

ID: 7977915_53017214, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Simone was a good host but can't say the same about the apartment. It wasn't clean, and is worn down. Beds, linen, and furniture are badly in need of updating. Dirty old curtains are placed over the sofa to hide extensive stains. The bathroom is extremely small and the shower door is broken. The street noise is extremely loud all night and early in the morning. Barcelona the city was wonderful, but the apartment was the low-light of our trip. We have stayed in dozens of AirBnB's and this is our first negative review. The apartment has a lot of potential, and with a few simple updates and a few hundred euros invested could be much improved. What a shame. 
ID: 8020706_70659800, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: We had a wonderful stay in the apartment.  It was exactly as described and very conveniently located.  The roof terrace was excellent.

Check out was equally simple and efficient.  We would definitely stay here again.

Lots of supermarcados nearby, some decent restaurants (burger joint next door really surprised us), and even came upon a karaoke a couple blocks away. Also, if you‚Äôre looking to get out of town for a day or two, theres a car rental spot 4 blocks away. I would make sure to thoroughly read through all of her messages, because she may include things you didn‚Äôt ask for. In my case it was early check in and I certainly wasn‚Äôt ready for that, which made for an unpleasant check in process.

Lots of restaurants nearby to eat out. Everything went as expected from checking in to checking out.

Also was told to not mentioned this is an airbnb if neighbor ask.<br/>The location itself was perfectly located right next to the train station, a fair review to be informative for other guests, would still recommend for people who are looking for a short stay for train or flight the next day.

We were debating between Raval and Gracia - and while there are benefits to each, the location of Michele's apartment was the best.  It was within walking distance of all the major locations, very close to metro stops, and right near a lot of great restaurants in El Born.  We also used the kitchen a few nights - which was modern with all the necessary items.  Check-in / Check-out were very easy, apartment was clean, and outside balcony was nice (although we were there in cooler February and did not use much).  Highly recommend for overall comfort and location.

The apartment was clean and new (especially the bathroom!).  We enjoyed our experience and loved being situated on a square frequented by mostly locals.
<br/>
<br/>The apartment is on the third floor, but there is a new lift in the building that takes you straight up.  There is free laundry (washer is in the apartment and dryer is shared) and that was very much appreciated on our long trip!
<br/>
<br/>Taking train from the airport was a cinch and the new train line was very clean and efficient.  Using the buses was a very similar experience to Chicago (easy).

Two different Metro stations around brought me fast and easy to everywhere in Barcelona. <br/>At arrival my flight was delayed and Jose and his Brother waited for me until two o‚Äòclock in the night  and still gave me a very friendly welcome.<br/>This is the best service ever!<br/>I missed nothing.<br/>I recommend this accomodation and hope that I can come back sometimes. <br/>Thanks!

ID: 820334535111222324_1225991909338220374, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Enjoyable stay even though  it was just 1 night. Instructions to get to the apt was very good however i took directions from the road  sign on exiting the metro and went in the opposite directionüôÑüòÆ‚Äçüí®. Just remember when using the elevator/lift/ascensor on exiting TURN IMMEDIATELY RIGHT as the street  is just 1 block from the street elevator......to the right....i went left as the sign read PL. whereas her address is Pi...<br/>The apt is very small and recommend  only a carryon bag as luggage anything else you will be cursing as there is no other room to store your luggage.<br/>Manuela who was presiding over the checkin for me was very understanding for my checkin  mistake and graciously allowed me to leave my bag tor pickup later.<br/>Thanks for everything and hopefully  see you soon<br/>Kevin

ID: 821100_21579611, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: I√±aki was very helpful and accomodating. The place is OUTSTANDING, and the location is right between two metro lines that can get you pretty much anywhere. Bedrooms are apart so there is plenty of privacy, the washer works great, and drying outside on the lines on the balcony was very easy and quicker than I expected.

<br/>We were a group of six and had plenty of room. If I ever come back to Barcelona, I hope this place is available!

Bathroom was excellent, smart TV, good bed, nice balcony.  Location is excellent many reasons: nearby supermarkets endless amount of coffees & restaurants, and for those, like me, who are more than happy for a 10 mins walk to the metro which will obviously take you anywhere you like in the city.  Location is also possibly the best in the entire city for those who want to do little 5-10k runs, as, after just 10 mins you are the coast which is an amazing run.  Also it is right on Diagonal Avenue which has dedicated running/cycling/walking path for miles.   Hosts were super responsive: they are an agency so of course it‚Äôs in their best interests.   I definitely recommend this spot.

ID: 838665876795139121_1227600261718890940, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The .ocation and what is in the apt profile page is accurate. For me that is all that was accurate.  One day after checking in i was a cused of using too much kitchen towel paper, then accused of banging doors/gates which later was told "all is good, don worry". 1 day later i was told yo leave the apt. Contacted airbnb and sfter much discussion  2 nights were refunded of my 4 night stay.<br/>needless to say this left me without accommodation and literally had to move heaven and earth to get accommodation for that night.<br/>From my viewpoint the host's actions were obviously prejudiced, immature and those of a person  bordering on mental delinquency/instability.

ID: 8433094_110068509, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Eduard is a great host: very communicative and willing to help out before and during your stay. He helped us figure out how to get to and from the airport to the apartment, gave us some bar/restaurant recommendations, and checked in daily to make sure we had what we needed.
<br/>
<br/>The apartment was very clean and comfortable. It was a different unit than the one pictured on the listing. This would have been fine had we known ahead of time, but access is via lockbox so it was confusing when we arrived to an apartment we did not expect. Thankfully we were able to confirm quickly that it was his. A few things in the apartment did not work properly (kitchen light switch, shower nozzle). I notified Eduard and he said they will be fixed for the next guests.
<br/>
<br/>The location is very convenient, right between Eixample and the Gothic Quarter. You can walk everywhere you want to go. The sound insulation is good, but it's a high-traffic street and there's a nightclub across the street that had booming bass and people yelling outside from 4am-7am on Saturday night. Our first night (a Thursday), the upstairs neighbors were drunkenly singing songs from 4-5:30am. They were quiet the rest of the weekend so I'm not sure if that's another rental unit - just something to be aware of.
<br/>
<br/>To sum up - Eduard is fantastic, the apartment is fine, the location fantastic. Just bring earplugs (or join the party).

The space was clean and well appointed, and we loved sitting in the little enclosed balcony in the evening. Sonia was very flexible and responsive during check-in. The neighborhood, off Pla√ßa Espanya, is very down to earth with a number of good bars and restaurants nearby. There are hotels in the area, but the streets around the apartment seem mainly to cater to locals. Great place to stay!

ID: 857958_19056842, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Ein Aufenthalt bei Vicky ist absolut empfehlenswert: Das Zimmer sind zwei n√§mlich ein Schlafzimmer und ein Wohnzimmer, dazu kommt ein eigenes kleines Bad mit Dusche und WC. Das Schlafzimmer ist in einer ehemaligen Bibliothek, sehr stylisch, sehr ruhig und angenehm zum Schlafen. Sollte es heiss sein sorgt eine Klimaanlage f√ºr angenehme Temperaturen in den R√§umen. Alles ist sehr sauber und aufger√§umt. Die K√ºche von Vicky kann mitbenutzt werden, es gibt Platz im K√ºhlschrank und Tee, Kaffee und frischgepressten Orangensaft. Vicky ist eine tolle Gastgeberin, die daf√ºr sorgt, dass man sich wie zu Hause f√ºhlt und die einen auch mal mitnimmt zu einem guten Restaurant oder auf den Geburtstag von Freunden. Sollte sie einmal nicht da sein, leistet Nino ihr Hauskater gerne Gesellschaft.  Alles in allem der perfekte Platz f√ºr ein paar tolle Tage in Barcelona.

ID: 8881364_528420236, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: My advice to anyone looking to stay in Barcelona, is look no further, you have to stay here!<br/>Wally is an absolutely fantastic host and you will not find anyone better, plus his apartment is stunning and perfect.<br/>It is no more than a 5 minute stroll from Barcelona Sants railway station and no more than a couple of minutes from a Metro stop in the other direction. Getting around the city could not be any easier.<br/>The apartment is in a family neighbourhood and you do not feel any unease whatever time of night you may be out and about. There is a lovely bakery opposite, with all freshly baked bread, cakes, croissants, etc which is open from early until late.<br/>The apartment itself is spotlessly clean and filled with every amenity you could wish for. The roof terrace is perfect for sitting and relaxing, and it has another surprise. In the corner is a separate small annexe which houses an automatic washing machine, separate tumble dryer, ironing board and iron. The first time we have ever come home with no dirty washing.<br/>I can't rate Wally or his apartment highly enough and my advice is simple......stop scrolling and book this before someone else does. You won't be sorry.

<br/>
<br/>The accommodation was always clean and well looked after. From the first minute we felt at home at Javier‚Äôs place. The location of Javier‚Äôs place is excellent. You can walk to the beach within 10-15 minutes. The metro station can also be quickly reached within a few minutes.
<br/>
<br/>The room to the Rambla was big and the beds were very comfortable. It is very practical that there is a balcony where you have seating furniture and a drying clothing rack.
<br/>
<br/>Besides this Javier offers his guests a small kitchen with a delicious breakfast with fresh fruits, coffee, tea, bread, croissants and juices.
<br/>
<br/>All in all we felt very welcomed by Javier and our stay was comfortable there. I would like to be his guest again.

For a family of four we had lot‚Äôs of room and it was the perfect location, and it was a clean, quiet place to rest and relax when we where not out sight seeing. Also some great restaurants and take out places very close to the unit made planning dinner hassle free. The host Claudio was excellent with communication, gave helpful suggestions, and provided a very seamless check-in and check-out process.
ID: 909007953674817274_998359002511157407, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: The space was great! Remember, it is just a room with a bathroom and the bathroom was definitely really small, but if you‚Äôre planning on spending the whole day exploring the city then Fabiana‚Äôs private room gets the job done! And the water pressure in the shower: 5 stars. All the amenities such as shampoo and shower gel were also included and they were nice enough to allow my friend and I to leave our bags past check out time since our train was leaving much later. Great hosts, great location of room, and great communication. I would definitely recommend a stay here.

ID: 915205387087324369_1023780329849473596, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Het appartement was brandschoon en heeft alles wat je nodig hebt. Het bevond zich vlakbij de Ramblas, het strand, Pla√ßa Reial en andere goede plekken. Het enige minpuntje wat ik kan bedenken is de discotheek in hetzelfde straatje, waar je wat geluidsoverlast van hebt van de mensen die naar buiten gaan.

ID: 916232_365392253, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Incredible location with easy access to metro, particularly to Barcelona Sants (one station away) and the airport (Aerobus service at Placa Catalunya).  Jepis was very responsive and answered all of my questions thoroughly, both before and during our stay.  We were personally greeted and shown the amenities of the apartment, as well as tips for the city. <br/> The space is warm and great to come back to after a long day of exploring.  Would definitely recommend.

Esta bastante peque√±o pero c√≥modo, es sobretodo un lugar para dormir despu√©s de su visita en Barcelona. La clima y ventilador estuvieron muy agradables en los d√≠as calientes de verano. Encontramos todo el necesario para nuestra estancia, en buena calidad y limpio<br/>Los anfitriones fueron muy amables y reactivos, y sus instrucciones para encontrar el lugar muy claras.<br/>Las calles alrededor est√°n un poco sucias, aunque parecen seguras y hay muchos comercios y transportes p√∫blicos cerca. <br/>El estacionamiento al lado esta bastante feo para los amortiguadores del coche pero tiene la ventaja de existir y de ser gratis, sabiendo lo dif√≠cil que es de estacionarse en Barcelona<br/>A pesar de eso, la estancia fue muy c√≥moda y practica

Location near Sagrada Familia and the beach made it easy to walk or take the Metro right around the corner. Plenty of space for the 9 of us to eat and spend time together which was a huge reason for our trip. <br/>My kids loved the loft space, probably because Dad was too tall to stand up so they could hide away. My one complaint is the ceiling in the master bathroom is low for someone 2 meters tall.

Away from the tourist trap location where you will get charge a lot more. Very close to el clot subway station which will take you to many locations including the airport. Also, el clot supermarket within a couple of block. You can buy any grocery and cook a the appartment but I'm too lazy for that, just bought Iberia ham and manchego cheese to have with my wine. Safe area too.

ID: 956768_1009310258389383982, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Excellent communication leading up to the day of our arrival. We came in from a cruise and we were off of the ship by 9am. Jose and Patricia allowed us to checkin immediately and drop our luggage. We were given instructions and keys and then we left to allow the cleaning to complete. The first night, we had a large cockroach crawl through the living room. Never saw any other one for the rest of our 3 night stay. The front bathroom had a very bad sewage smell and was not useable. The hosts responded when one of our guests became ill and had great recommendations on where to seek healthcare. We informed them of the cockroach and never had a response. Excellent location right in the heart of Barcelona.

ID: 959089_978084421959856955, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: This is far more than an airbnb stay! If you like old mansions, if you like Baroque/Rococo and Art Deco styles, trust me, this can be a attraction for Barcelona! We didn't get to meet Sean, but we were hosted by his parents, John and Frances. During our stay, it really felt like we were visiting a distant friend's place. We arrived in Barcelona in the middle of the night, and John kept messaging me to confirm our arrival time, came downstairs to open the door himself, and explained the layout of the masion and the functions of each room, while Frances told us about the house's history and  interesting stories of celebrities and movie stars that have visited here. My God I think I really need to see this movie again. In a word, CASA RAMOS represents airbnb at the highest level: a unique and homely experience!

Check in was extremly smooth. The place is tiny but very clean enough and all shared bathrooms being cleaned frequently. Not the quietest place though but we were told when we picked it so it was fine. Bring yourself a pair of earplugs would be really helpful by the way.
ID: 961548_1049174260915953189, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Traveling to a foreign country with a 1 yr old and a 4 yr old, this place was perfect for us. Some of thoughtful amenities: step stool in the bathroom for little ones to reach the sink and the toilet, plastic bowls and utensils for children, sippy cup, bib, high chair, portable crib with stuffed animals, infant bathtub to use in the shower. <br/>Look no further if traveling light with young kids. <br/>Location is great, 2 blocks from the metro and in the hip Gr√†cia neighborhood that isn‚Äôt as mobbed with tourists as other parts of the city.
ID: 963289_28862168, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Maria Luisa is an excellent, responsive host. She even provided bottled water, fruit, and a bottle of wine for our arrival. Her apartment was accurately described, clean, and very well-located. It was particularly convenient for us because we wanted to be close to Sants station (to get in and out of Barcelona) and wanted to be able to explore Barcelona during our stay there, which was easily done through using the Tarragona metro station, which is even closer and is on a major metro line. All five of us were very pleased with our stay and would return. We would strongly recommend this apartment to others -- just be sure to bring your own soap and shampoo! It was also helpful that she had an English-speaking coworker when we arrived.
ID: 963289_9927653, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Terrific apartment in a good quiet neighborhood close enough to downtown by Metro.

Johanna‚Äôs apartment provided the perfect end to our holiday.<br/>The location is fantastic in a quiet but very central residential district. There is a small supermarket two doors away, a bakery at the corner of the next block and the Girona Metro station a two minute walk away. We walked to most of the major attractions, restaurants etc easily and hopped on the L4 Metro line from Girona when we needed to go a little further (beach or Parc Guell).<br/>The apartment is spacious, stylish and has a wonderful terrace that catches the sun for most of the day. It has a lovely big bathroom also, which is always helpful with small children.<br/>Overall, one of the best AirBNB rentals that we have stayed in. We‚Äôll definitely be back if we visit Barca again!<br/>

ID: 978990_538722810, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: I only wrote that Ron's place was "as expected" because as you can see all his reviews are excellent and we knew exactly what to expect. Ron and Tadaaki were very hospitable and we enjoyed sharing glasses of wine with both of them. Their tips and suggestions on how to enjoy the city were bang on and they genuinely want their guests to have a great time at their apartment, as opposed to just supplying a place to sleep. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to any friend that they should check availability with Ron before others, and I hope we have a chance to enjoy their company again. P.S..... Danko is an excellent and affectionate host as well !
ID: 978990_546210700884261161, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Ron, Tadaaki and Danko are really great hosts. You are warmly welcomed and you feel directly as part of the apartment. Every question about Barcelona, or even private things is answered warmly. <br/>The apartment is very very clean. You have your own room and your own bathroom. The room is quiet and the bed is comfortable. In the morning there is a wonderful breakfast served at a desired time with fruit, cheese, sausage, homemade jam and homemade bread. Ron and Tadaaki are extremely affable people who also like to have a drink in the evening, like wine on the couch with you and have great conversations. Danko is a great dog who is very calm and loves to be petted without being pushy.<br/>The location of the apartment is stunning. Walking distance to many things you want to see in Barcelona. In the area are many restaurants and in 10 minutes you can also reach the beautiful port and the beach. <br/>My girlfriend and I will definitely visit Barcelona again and if Ron, Tadaaki and Danko have time, we will want to stay with them again.<br/>All in all we can only say thank you for the amazing and uncomplicated stay and for the incredible hospitality!<br/>Greetings from Cologne

The appartment is beautiful and we even used it to stage a photoshoot n the small balcony.<br/>The communication with Jordi was clear and extremely fast.
ID: 9841823_115855658, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Xavier is a kind and gracious host. The place was nice and in a great area. However, as one reviewer mentioned, we also had a run in with some critters on the ground and bed. Unfortunately one of us had been bitten as well. Xavier was understanding and handled the situation well, and he has assured us he would take care of the issue. This aside, we enjoyed our stay at his place. He also makes pick up to and from the airport very convenient.

ID: 988917_77767323, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Since this was my first Airbnb experience, I wasn't sure what to expect. But I shouldn't have worried ‚Äî both David and the apartment were fantastic!  He was waiting for us when we arrived and was helpful and courteous showing us around his apartment. And the apartment was great!  Super location and perfect for a  facility of four. I wouldn't hesitate to book David's place again--it was truly a top-tier experience. Thanks David!

ID: 988917_984610568602329184, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: David's place is located very close to the Barcelona Sants train station which made it very easy.  It also has a great cafe just on the corner with awesome pastries and sandwiches.<br/>The only downside to the place is the size of the washroom, I am 5' tall and it was pretty tight for me.

ID: 9977956_615752210037694649, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: Our stay at this residence began with a wonderful welcome by David, with chocolate and wine! David was an exceptional host who responded immediately to any questions we had. He definitely went above and beyond as a host! <br/>The residence itself was very clean with an excellent shower. It was incredibly close to La Rambla, the gothic quarter and several metro stations.<br/>Would definitely recommend.
ID: 9977956_899073968851648467, Reviewer: Kevin, Comment: David was a very helpful host and responded to messages very quickly. <br/>The flat is in a great location, close to shops, restaurants and bars but just far enough away from the busiest areas to provide a quiet haven when needed. It was well-placed to access all the delights of Barcelona - of which there are many.<br/>The flat had all the space and facilities we required and it was clean and functional. It managed to be quite stylish but still homely. It's not the most perfectly maintained and presented place we've ever stayed but everything worked well enough and I'm sure David would have resolved any issues quickly had we asked him.  <br/>In summary, the flat was well-placed and provided everything we needed at a very good price.  Very good value!
