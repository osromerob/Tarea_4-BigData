ID: 18674_1170953004846340251, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: Séjour parfait pour un long week-end entre amis.
ID: 18674_278588962, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: Great location and enough space in the apartment for 7 people. Although the mattresses were a bit too soft and the house is quite noisy, its a solid choice for a big group of people for a weekend in barcelona.
ID: 18674_408388148, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: Our experience here was mixed. <br/>The location of this flat is super close to La Sagrada Familia, and there are lots of cute restaurants and cafes nearby. <br/>The flat itself wad impersonal and not well represented by the photos. The folks who rent this spot have a bunch of other places in the city. So even though it was spacious, it lacked charm, and was heavily used without being heavily cleaned.<br/>There were extra pillows, but no extra pillow cases; the one spare blanket was covered in unwashed food stains (as was the furniture); and while the large bed was comfy, the small bed I slept in felt like laying on a box filled with metal springs. <br/>I have an Airbnb if my own, and work very hard to accurately represent my space. It was disappointing not to find that to be the case here.<br/>That said, check-in was easy, and when we had trouble with the heater, the response was quick.

<br/>Very good service, excellent location.
<br/>Recommended.
ID: 18674_434013302, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: Super fast and easy check-in and very friendly service. The price is fair and the apartment has enough space for 7 people. The locations of this flat is amazing. There are lots of cute restaurants, cafes and supermarkets nearby. More or less 3min walking distance to la Sagrada Familia, few bus stops and a metro station close by. <br/>During our stay it wasn't so hot outside so we needed to turn on the heater. It takes a while until it warms up the flat so you may can feel cold as we did.

ID: 18674_449270399, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: Todo bien. Como oportunidad recomendaria mejorar la aislacion de ruido y de calor. Se sentían ruidos de otros departamentos y era frío.
ID: 18674_455900271, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: Buena ubicación, linda vista.
ID: 18674_463457868, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: Great Location with a lovely morning view of the Segrada Família. Anna from Barcelona4seasons was punctual and exceptionally helpful in advising on the best way to spend our time in Barcelona. <br/>The apartment was clean, slightly quirky and had everything we needed. The building itself could do with a facelift and the lift is a little tight but all in all a very comfortable stay.
ID: 18674_480168541, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: Nice place next to sagrada , a bit far from downtown and the beaches tough. Kitchen facilities are good , bedrooms are ok for 6 people. One bathroom is good sie but the small one was really very small. Furnitures and overall equipment were new. Towels , linens etc were very clean.
ID: 18674_4808211, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: Great location. Clean, spacious flat. Would recommend to anyone.
ID: 18674_480903422105386575, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: Super appartement, fonctionnel, Maria et Mireai sont très réactive. <br/>Appartement peut être un peu bruyant mais sinon tout est top
ID: 18674_501793870, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: Appartement bien situé. Les matelas ne sont pas top, un peu trop mou et la clim est quasi inexistante. Donc difficile de dormir sans climatisation dans les chambres.
ID: 18674_522979142783860532, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: Great location and amazing view!
ID: 18674_526688056, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: Es un gran apartamento con todas las comodidades. Esta a 2 cuadras de Sagrada Familia y de la estación. Puedes llegar caminando a otros lugares de interés de Barcelona. Es un gran lugar para descansar luego de recorrer la ciudad!
ID: 18674_544887011, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: This place is conveniently located close to the Sagrada Familia and public transport.  It was very spacious and great for larger families or groups.  Checking into the place was done remotely so make sure your phone is charged when arriving at the place as we had to call our hosts when we arrived and they buzzed us in.  Unfortunately, I think I was allergic to something in the apartment as my eyes become itchy and watered when I was in the unit but cleared up when we went outside. Once I got allergy medicine from the pharmacy It helped me to enjoy my stay and we were out exploring the city most of the time.  Also, we were told and agreed upon a prompt 11 am check out time but were awoken at 8 am by the next guest entering the unit with keys...?  After a brief language barrier (she was Italian) we agreed to check out early since we were already up, while she left her luggage in the unit and left to give us our space/time.    The unit itself was clean and a great deal for the price/location.  We are very laid back people so these two little upsets really didn't affect our wonderful time exploring Barcelona.
ID: 18674_546913674, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: The apartment is lovely, its spacious and has plenty of areas to relax when you're at home. The flat is also well connected and easy to get to from all areas of Barcelona. A great place for a group of friends who want a comfortable, clean and safe place to hang out before heading into Barcelona for the day / night.

ID: 18674_562888883859558785, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: We had a very nice time at this apartment. We enjoyed the sunny living room with the balcony the most.
ID: 18674_612101294979598070, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: Wij hadden een kort maar prima verblijf in dit appartement. De communicatie met de host was goed en ze was erg behulpzaam. De locatie is erg goed met mooi uitzicht op de Kathedraal.
ID: 18674_638222583889413519, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: Es un apartamento enorme con las habitaciones en la parte del apartamento que no da a la calle, con lo cual es una delicia para dormir y descansar. La zona del salón con la terracota es muy agradable para desayunar viendo la Sagrada Familia. Muy recomendable.
ID: 18674_700532688387587838, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: I’m really disappointed about the whole experience to be honest. First of all, We arrange a checkout hour the first day, then the owner told us that we had to leave earlier and the last day she told us that we have to leave even earlier, so communication was terrible.<br/>The kitchen flood as soon as we arrive and they fixed the next day so we didn’t have kitchen for 2 of the 3 days basically . But I think the worst part was that they actually told us when we did the check in and after we paid that we he to be extremely quiet during night (which wasn’t in the house rules or anything) because if we did any noises the neighbors will call the police and if that happens we had to leave the apartment right away. There was actually a sign in the building lobby that said that if there was any inconvenient with the “tourist apartment” call the police. So we really don’t recommend this experience for anyone. Also the description said the the  had Air conditioning, and there was only AC at the to living rooms and one didn’t even work. So the rooms are super hot

ID: 18674_713612711374507594, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: Before I start my review, I just want to let you know that I am a long-standing Air BNBer with lots of positive reviews. I have generally had good experiences but this stay was not good.<br/>Firstly the property is not run by Mirea & Maria but by a property management company, Barcelona4Seasons. I point this out because a big draw for me to this property was that I would be dealing with members of the LGBTIQ+ community. It’s worth noting this. Communications ahead of time were generally good and they were responsive. There was however a significant problem which led to my party abandoning the property.  <br/>The apartment is fantastically located in Sagrada Familia district. The apartment is an older apartment block and is definitely ‘vintage’. <br/> <br/>The problem is that there are significant building works going on to the rear of the apartment. These are major. They look like they have been there for some time and are likely to continue for several months. They create significant noise pollution which is heard throughout the apartment but specifically loudest at the rear of the building where 2 of the bedrooms are located. There is significant dust and debris produced by the building works also. <br/>This will have several impacts on your stay:<br/>- unless you are a deep sleeper you are likely to be woken during the day by the building works.<br/>- you will not be able to return to the apartment during the day as any rest you may wish to take will be impacted by the works.<br/>- you will be unable to leave the rear apartment windows open during the day because of the dust.<br/>I think therefore currently this would not make for a good holiday/tourist stay. It might be appropriate if you are staying for work.<br/>My friends who arrived first during the afternoon discovered this problem and refused to stay. They felt unsafe and, as this was part of their honeymoon, I don’t blame them. They recorded good video footage which shows the extent of the building works and the noise pollution. I am happy to share this on request.<br/>I immediately reported this to Barcelona4Seasons on my arrival. They denied knowledge of this significant building project and were unable to offer a refund or to rehouse us. They stated that they were unaware of these works. I find this comment surprising given that cleaners are coming into the apartment regularly and the scale of work. We were therefore obliged to find alternative accomodation and I am actively pursuing a refund.<br/>My stay was on the8th September and am writing this on 24 th September. I have looked at the listing today and note that no mention is made of the property management company or the building works. I would have hoped to have been told about the building works ahead of my stay as this would have impacted my  choice to stay here. I hope this helps you make an informed choice ahead of your stay. <br/>I hope by the time you read this the omissions in the listing have been updated as this could have been a great spot to stay were it not for the conditions.

ID: 18674_81000756, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: The Check in was fast and flexible. The price is fair, because the flat ist big enough for 8 people if you are flexible as well. We were the in a time where it wasn't so hot outside, so I have no idea how hot it can get inside. This was my second Airbnb stay so I can't compare it so good with other apartments but I would wish me, that the owner, offers the guests more toilet paper  etc. . Because if it is a short stay, you don't want to buy all the staff in big packages. <br/>All in all we are very happy with this decision

ID: 18674_903492245888962904, Listing ID: 18674, Comment: This was exactly what my friends and I were looking for during our stay in Barcelona. The location was amazing, with views of the Sagrada Familia, and many places were walking distance. It accommodated the 7 of us easily and the highlight for us were the bathrooms. We spent more time outside the apartment than inside, and it served us as a great place to come back from a day of exploring to rest, recover, and rejuvenate ourselves for more exploration! <br/>The listing is as advertised and the host was very responsive, and while we didn’t make any particular requests during the stay, I’m sure they would’ve been answered promptly.
